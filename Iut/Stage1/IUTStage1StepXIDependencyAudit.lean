CI-facing dependency audit for the Step (xi) localized `C_Theta` boundary.

The declarations below intentionally do not reprove the long Step (xi) routes.
They pin the latest localized boundary audits to stable short names and record
their expected projection fields.  If the preferred public route loses one of
these constructor-built handoffs, this module stops compiling.

Classification for the canonical Stage 1 public boundary.

`sourceObligation` marks mathematics that still has to be constructed from the
IUT papers before the 3.11-to-3.12 corridor is closed.  `interfaceOnly` marks
typed bookkeeping that selects an operation or index surface but is not itself
a mathematical comparison theorem.

The AdditiveHaarBridge now projects the additive-Haar, p-adic prime-error, arithmetic-degree calibrated, formula-gap matched, arithmetic-divisor-backed local-degree, constructed Theorem 3.11 local-term, valuation-ball arithmetic-degree tower, and Record-Ob3/Ob5 valuation-ball source directly into the canonical residual package; the strongest checked bridge is Experiments.ConstructedTheorem311OneSidedIUTIVTheorem110ValuationBallHaarArithmeticDivisorBackedMatchedLocalDegreeComponentStepXILocalTermCThetaSource.RecordOb3Ob5ArithmeticDivisorBackedValuationBallSource.toCoreLocalArithmeticDegreeResidualSource.  The current canonical residual frontier is lower than both the local-degree formula valuation-ball source and the ordinary arithmetic-degree-controlled component source: it uses the Record-Ob3/Ob5 p-adic-defect/main valuation-ball controlled component source.  That source derives the strict p-adic-Haar controlled source from a single valuation-ball local-estimate object whose prime-error term is definitionally E_v = delta_v + M_v; the valuation-ball evaluation source, Haar-index defect source, split equality, arithmetic-degree-controlled local source, and component/formula synchronization equality are no longer separate fields at this lower boundary.  The same p-adic-defect/main controlled source now feeds both the compact-open controlled product-handoff route and the compact-open projected-local-degree formula route through Experiments.ConstructedTheorem311OneSidedIUTIVTheorem110AdditiveHaarMatchedLocalDegreeArithmeticDivisorBackedComponentStepXILocalTermCThetaSource.RecordOb3Ob5ArithmeticDivisorBackedPadicDefectMainValuationBallControlledComponentSource.preferredPublicConcreteStepXI311312CompactOpenAdditiveHaarRecordOb3Ob5PadicDefectMainControlledProductHandoffFormulaRealizedRoute and Experiments.ConstructedTheorem311OneSidedIUTIVTheorem110AdditiveHaarMatchedLocalDegreeArithmeticDivisorBackedComponentStepXILocalTermCThetaSource.RecordOb3Ob5ArithmeticDivisorBackedPadicDefectMainValuationBallControlledComponentSource.preferredPublicConcreteStepXI311312CompactOpenAdditiveHaarRecordOb3Ob5PadicDefectMainProjectedLocalDegreeFormulaProductHandoffFormulaRealizedRoute, replacing the separate p-adic-Haar local analytic object, defect source, calibration, split, comparison bounds, local-degree formula projection, and component/formula equalities at that surface.  The stronger local-degree formula valuation-ball source remains checked as a comparison route.  This strict source feeds both the p-adic defect/main local-estimate source and the canonical residual package directly.  The Step XI arithmetic-degree equality is therefore audited as a consequence of determinant-weight and adjusted raw-log-volume calibration.  The additive-Haar split can be constructed from a local analytic arithmetic-divisor evaluation source plus the p-adic equality E_v = delta_v + M_v; the valuation-ball p-adic defect/main source now builds that equality into the prime-error term, and it is itself constructible from the arithmetic-degree-controlled local arithmetic source by combining E_v = localIUTIVDefect_v + M_v with localIUTIVDefect_v = delta_v.  The arithmetic-defect record is canonicalized extensionally by Experiments.IUTStage1FinitePlaceIUTIVLocalArithmeticDefectSource.eq_ofPadicUnitBallHaarIndex, and the whole arithmetic-degree-controlled local source is now canonicalized by Experiments.IUTStage1ValuationBallHaarTheorem110StepXIArithmeticDegreeControlledLocalArithmeticSource.eq_ofPadicUnitBallHaarIndex, so localIUTIVDefect_v is not an independent numerical input once the p-adic Haar defect source is fixed.  The strict residual countermodel PadicHaarControlledResidualWithoutDefinitionalSynchronizationToyCountermodel shows that the component residual and reconstructed p-adic residual can diverge if the controlled component/formula synchronization is weakened.  The remaining IUT IV obligation is deriving the complete lower valuation-ball Record-Ob3/Ob5 local-estimate source itself from the full paper-level local-estimate construction." } ]

Residual-frontier evidence for the canonical route.

This sub-manifest records the current lower p-adic-defect/main boundary below
the `localArithmeticDegreeResidualSource` entry.  The former canonical source
obligation was the Record-Ob3/Ob5 controlled component source whose
valuation-ball local-estimate input is the p-adic-defect/main Theorem~1.10
object.  That package is now derived from the stronger local-degree formula
valuation-ball source: the proof reconstructs the p-adic-defect/main object,
uses valuation-ball projection preservation to identify the projected
additive-Haar evaluation object, and transports the controlled component across
the p-adic Haar-index canonicalization.  The countermodels record why the
p-adic defect/main split and formula synchronization cannot be weakened.

One-place diagnostic model for the p-adic finite source boundary.

The canonical route now reads the local weighted Step~(xi) scale from the
finite-extension restriction-calibrated handoff.  This toy model records the
failure mode of the weakened boundary that allowed a detached p-adic finite
source to supply its own scale: the handoff-derived theta identity can hold
while the detached identity is false.

The new p-adic unit-ball lower-bound projection ultimately uses

keeps q-positivity and the IUT IV-style upper bound

One-place diagnostic for the local-analytic case-source boundary.

The scale-synchronized local-analytic case-source route uses the ordinary local
case upper bound together with the distinguished \(+1\) gap.  This toy model
keeps the ordinary distinguished local comparison but deletes the \(+1\) gap.
Then the residual lower bound needed by the formula-gap case residual source is
false.

After the canonical route is lowered from the case-bounded IUT~IV source to the
local arithmetic-degree residual source, the essential remaining numerical law
is the residual lower bound.  This toy model keeps the local arithmetic-degree
identity but reverses the lower bound; the \(C_\Theta\)-style one-unit residual
needed by the endpoint is then unavailable.

The p-adic route removes the residual lower bound only because the local
residual is identified with the unit-ball dilation index
`p_v^[K_v : Q_p]`, whose normalized-place contribution is at least `1`.
If that lower p-adic index law is weakened to an arbitrary synchronized
"index", the Step~(xi) identity can still hold while the one-unit residual
needed by the canonical endpoint fails.

The arithmetic-degree-controlled source gives the prime-error identity in the

`E_v = delta_v + M_v` only by using the IUT~IV arithmetic-defect
identification `localIUTIVDefect_v = delta_v`.  If that identification is
weakened away, the defect/main identity can hold while the p-adic split fails.

The strict source now projects directly to the canonical residual package only
because its controlled component is assembled over the formula object
reconstructed from p-adic Haar-index data.  If one weakens this source by
keeping the p-adic Haar-index and arithmetic-degree reconstruction laws but
allows the Record-Ob3/Ob5 component residual to refer to a detached component
formula, then the residual seen by the component and the residual reconstructed
