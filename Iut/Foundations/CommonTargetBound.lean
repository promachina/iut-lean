Measured bounds for common targets of comparison families.

This file packages the order-theoretic output shape needed after a future
`hull+det` construction: a family of possible target regions is contained in a
common target, and the common target has a measured upper bound.

No IUT-specific construction of the common target is asserted here.

namespace RealLineCopy

namespace RegionComparisonFamily

variable {source target : Copy} {index : Type u}

/--
All target regions in a comparison family have measured volume at most `bound`.

This is the conclusion obtained from a measured common target; keeping it as a
separate predicate makes it easy to state what later IUT-specific constructions
must deliver.
