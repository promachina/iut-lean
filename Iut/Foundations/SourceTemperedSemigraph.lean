# Tempered semi-graph source mathematics

This module starts the source-faithful reconstruction of the semi-graph results
used by IUT I, Proposition 2.4 and Corollary 2.5.  It formalizes the finite-group
fixed-component, unique-geodesic, and subjoint results in *Semi-graphs of
Anabelioids*, Lemma 1.8(ii)(a-c), and the subgroup-conjugation argument that
derives the cuspidal portion of IUT I, Corollary 2.5 from Proposition 2.4(i).

For the first step of *Semi-graphs of Anabelioids*, Theorem 3.7(iii), it also
proves that the continuous image of a compact group in a discrete deck group
is finite, applies Lemma 1.8 to obtain a fixed component, and uses the
over-base branch map to upgrade it to a fixed original vertex.  It also proves
the Definition 2.4(iv) estranged-branch contradiction once the subgroup
containments supplied by Remark 2.2.1 are available.  That group-containment
passage, its stabilizer-to-verticial-subgroup identification, the
maximal-compact/verticial classification, and the inverse-limit passage in IUT
I, Proposition 2.4(i), are not asserted here.

/-- *Semi-graphs of Anabelioids*, Lemma 1.8(ii)(c): if a group fixes three
distinct original vertices of a semi-graph tree, it acts trivially on a
subjoint.  Once the three vertices are fixed, the proof does not use finiteness
of the acting group.  It extracts consecutive edges from fixed geodesics and
uses the degree-one boundary condition to show that their common point is an
original vertex. -/
