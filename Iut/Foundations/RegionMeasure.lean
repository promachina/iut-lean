Abstract real-valued measures of regions.

This file records only the monotonicity shape needed for log-volume estimates:
if one region is contained in another, then its assigned real value is no larger.
It does not define IUT log-volume analytically.

A measure is normalized on upper rays when it assigns the upper-ray bound as
the numerical value of that upper ray.

This is a calibration property for toy models and later comparison statements;
it is not part of the definition of an arbitrary region measure.
