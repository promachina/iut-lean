Bridge schema from certified algorithmic output to common-target bounds.

This file does not assert that IPL, SHE, or APT imply any bound. It packages the
extra source-specific construction that would turn a certified output into a
measured common-target bound.

namespace Iut
namespace RealLineCopy

namespace AlgorithmicOutput

variable {source target : Copy} {index : Type u}

/--
A source-specific constructor that turns certification of an algorithmic output
into measured common-target-bound data.

For the IUT project this is the abstract place where a future formalization of
the "3.11 => 3.11.5" step should live.

/--
A bridge whose source-specific construction consumes structured IPL/SHE/APT data
for the transported family.

This is still only a schema: the bridge is supplied explicitly and is not
derived from the qualitative data by automation or axioms.

/--
Inert identifier for the hull+det operation used in the source-specific bridge.

This name carries no mathematical content by itself. It only prevents the
eventual determinant/log-volume passage from being hidden inside an unnamed
bridge.
-/
structure HullDetOperationId where
  label : String

/--
A named hull+det operation together with the structured bridge it supplies.

The bridge remains explicit data: this record does not derive a bound from the
identifier. Future milestones should refine the identifier into actual descent,
holomorphic-hull, determinant, and log-volume constructions.
