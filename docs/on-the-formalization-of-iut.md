§1. Lean formalization (“LeanForm”) as a communication tool
· The significance of LeanForm: verification vs. communication:
Classically, the significance of LeanForm is typically regarded as
lying in the verification of the logical correctness of a mathema-
tical theory. In the case of IUT, however, although this verifica-
tion aspect of LeanForm is welcome, in fact the logical structure
of the theory is rather simple, so this verif. aspect of LeanForm
is not a central focal point of interest from the point of view of
researchers in IUT. Rather, in the case of IUT, the significance
of LeanForm lies in producing a precise record of the logical str.
of IUT that is immune to false misinterpretations and hence
can be used, in a pivotal way, to communicate this simplicity
in a maximally eﬃcient/precise way to other mathematicians.
· The key to overcoming formidable communication barriers lies
in breaking out of the following
(closely interrelated!) vicious cycles:
“The logic of
(supposedly diﬃcult
portions of) IUT
is in fact very simple
and elementary.”
Accusations (without any
mathematical proof!):
“Don’t insult me/my intel-
ligence!” or “It’s entirely
inconceivable that the abc
inequality could follow
from such simple logic!”
⇑ ⇓
“It’s impossible to become
suﬃciently motivated to
study [IUTchI-IV] seriously
without confidence that the
theory is correct, e.g., by
synopsis of the argument!”
seeing a suﬀ’ly transparent
“In order to understand
the logic of IUT in a
genuine/rigorous way,
it is necessary to study
[IUTchI-IV] in detail
(as many others have
already done!).”
LeanForm oﬀers (to my knowledge) the first technology that ap-
pears to have the technical capacity to allow us to break free of
such vicious cycles, i.e., by providing confidence via a precise and
logically verified record of the logical structure of IUT that can
be processed by a machine in a fraction of a second in a way that
is entirely immune to nonmathematical accusations (such as
those discussed above) or the human mental fatigue/stress that
occurs when trying to comprehend an unfamiliar mathematical
theory (cf. [RptIUT], §3.2, (LnIm)).
FORMALIZATION OF IUT: PRELIMINARY PROGRESS REPORT 3
· Unfortunately, the issue of confidence in correctness has a very
human, nonmathematical social/political dimension:
That is to say, no one wants to invest substantial resources of
time and eﬀort in a “shinking ship”. Ultimately, social/political
power may be understood as a reflection of perceived capacity to
reliably deliver/ensure long-term mathematical accountability for
the mathematical correctness of results/assertions. Thus, to my
knowledge, LeanForm appears to be the first technology that has
the technical capacity do this in a fashion that is intrinsically in-
dependent of/unshackled from human social/political structures.
· From a purely technical point of view, the essence of LeanForm
— at least in the case of IUT — lies in undertaking a fundamental
reorganization of the theory into
suitable purely formal/combinatorial blackboxes
— cf. [RptIUT], §3.2, (MthFm), (BBxFm), (BBxDD); §4 below
for technical details of this reorganization in the case of the final
portion of IUT, which has received the most public attention.
· The Lean code to be discussed in §4 below arose precisely from
the challenges presented by the task of communicating IUT to
mathematicians (arithmetic geometers) who are thoroughly fa-
miliar with Lean, but who had only a relatively superficial know-
ledge of IUT (cf. [RptIUT], (LnCom)). This situation was remar-
kable in that it had the eﬀect of
faithfully recreating in a “laboratory” the vicious cycles
discussed above, but in a generally friendly/productive nontoxic
environment, while still preserving the essential dynamics and
overall sense of utter hopelessness and frustration that are char-
acteristic of such vicious cycles. The remarkable conclusion to
the story is that the Lean code discussed in §4 had the power to
overcome these vicious cycles and, in particular, to
successfully and eﬃciently record, in a nonnegatable fashion,
the logic of the final portion of IUT.
We note, however, that this Lean code is still in a somewhat
skeletal/bare bones form, i.e., its success as a communication tool
depends on the level of understanding of the mathematicians
involved (i.e., on the receiving end) of the basic set-up of IUT
and of the main issues involved. In particular, it will still take
some more time before suﬃciently many details can be added to
“flesh out” the Lean code to a degree that it is suitable for release
to the general public.

§2. First steps toward the LeanForm of IUT
· The main strategy for the LeanForm of IUT:
Stage 1: [IUTchIII] Theorem 3.11 = ⇒ Corollary 3.12
(since this has received the most public attention!)
Stage 2: Proof of [IUTchIII] Theorem 3.11 modulo [IUTchI-II]
Stage 3: [IUTchI-II] modulo earlier results (1995 - 2015) on
anabelian geometry/Frobenioids/theta functions, etc.
Stage 4: Earlier results (1995 - 2015): [pGC], [GeoAn], [AbsAnb],
[NCBel], [AbSc], [SemiAn], [QuCnf], [CbGC], [Config],
[FrdI-II], [EtTh], [GenEll], [NodNon], [AbsTopI-III]
Stage 5: Numerical aspects ([IUTchIV], [ExpEst])
(We are currently in the early “skeletal” portion of Stage 1.)
Here, the current main focus is on Stages 1 and 2 since Stage 1
has received the most public attention, but in fact is not so diﬃ-
cult and ultimately (when understood properly!) just shows that
what one is really interested in is Stage 2. Moreover, Stages 1
and 2 most likely require the most human intervention, i.e., ulti-
mately (most probably!) in terms of having my research group
at RIMS actually write the skeletal Lean code, as in the case dis-
cussed in detail in §4. By contrast, the mathematical content of
Stages 4 and 5, as well as (to a lesser extent) Stage 3, are under-
stood by a much larger class of mathematicians and have never
been a source of confusion/debate, hence should be regarded as
long-term goals that seem much more amenable to LeanForm by
research groups not so closely connected to my research group
at RIMS, e.g., (perhaps) via machine-based autoformalization.
· The theory of species/mutations:
As was mentioned to me by one Lean expert, it is of fundamental
importance to begin any LeanForm project with a formalization
of the basic definitions underlying the theory to be formalized.
In the case of IUT, this amounts to formalizing the notion of a
“functorial algorithm” (i.e., in more technical language, the no-
tion of a “mutation”), which, in essence, amounts to the theory
of species/mutations. This notion of a functorial algorithm is of
fundamental importance not only in IUT, but also in anabelian
geometry (of the sort that is relevant to IUT), as well as, in a
certain sense, in pure mathematics as a whole.
species: a type of mathematical object (such as a group, scheme,
diagram of schemes, etc.) defined (in a fashion that is
independent of any particular model ZFC set theory!)
by some set-theoretic formula
mutation: a construction of one species from another that is de-
fined (in a fashion that is independent of any particu-
lar ZFC-model!) by some set-theoretic formula
FORMALIZATION OF IUT: PRELIMINARY PROGRESS REPORT 5
· Thus,
a species determines a category of species-objects, while
a mutation determines a functor between associated categories
of species-objects.
Put another way, one may regard species/mutations as a sort of
natural refinement of the classical notions of categories/functors.
Alternatively, and more precisely, if one is willing to go up “one
step” in the hierarchy of universes under consideration, then one
may regard species/mutations as internal categories/functors in
the syntactic category associated to ZFC regarded as a first order
theory. In particular, it follows that the LeanForm of species/mu-
tations becomes essentially immediate once one has a LeanForm
of ZFC as a first order theory. In the fall of 2025, I discovered,
on the one hand, that such a LeanForm had in fact already re-
cently been achieved by a young Japanese researcher named Sho-
go Saito, but, on the other hand, (was quite surprised to learn!)
that such a LeanForm does not yet exist in MathLib (the stan-
dard library for refereed Lean code). Here, we observe that the
technical significance of formalizing ZFC as a first order theory
lies in the fact that this is necessary in order to be able to work
with “some indeterminate set-theoretic formula φ” (i.e., as op-
posed to specific set-theoretic formulas“a∈A”, “B ⊆C∩D”,
etc., which are “natively” available in Lean).
· Ultimately, as a result of various consultations with Lean experts,
I reached the conclusion that in fact the formalization of species/
mutations in the abstract using some sort of LeanForm of ZFC as
a first order theory (though ultimately theoretically desirable at
some possibly much later stage in the project!) was most likely
not necessary for the LeanForm of (at least Stages 1∼2 of) IUT.
Instead, suitable use of standard Lean commands for formalizing
types of mathematical objects and relationships between various
respective “component pieces of data” in the input/output of a
functor seems to be suﬃcient for formalizing the logic of IUT
(at least in the case of Stages 1∼2 — cf. the Lean code discussed
below in §4).
· Nevertheless, the nonexistence of a LeanForm in MathLib of ZFC
as a first order theory made a strong impression on me, especial-
ly considering how fundamental ZFC as a first order theory is
throughout pure mathematics. Indeed, this situation struck me
as a remarkable example of the power of Lean as a communication
tool (cf. §1), namely, by faithfully communicating/reflecting the
nonexistence — i.e., in the mathematics that has already been
formalized in MathLib — of the algorithmic construction point
of view, which is so fundamental to the logic of IUT, as well as
related anabelian geometry, and which seems to have been one
substantial obstacle to the study of IUT for many mathemati-
cians who are not familiar with this point of view.

· Let R be an integral domain (e.g., Z ⊆Q) equipped with the
action of a group G, (Z ∋) N ≥2. For simplicity, assume that
N = 1+···+1 ̸= 0 ∈R; Rhas no nontrivial N-th roots of unity.
Write R◃⊆R for the multiplicative monoid R\{0}. Then
let us observe that the N-th power map on R◃determines an
isomorphism of multiplicative monoids equipped with actions
G R◃ ∼
→ (R◃)N (⊆R◃) G
that does not arise from a ring homomorphism, i.e., it is clearly
not compatible with addition (cf. our assumption on N!).
· Let †R,
‡R be two distinct copies of the integral domain R,
equipped with respective actions by two distinct copies †G,
‡G
of the group G. We shall use similar notation for objects with
labels “†”, “‡” to the previously introduced notation. Then
one may use the isomorphism of multiplicative monoids arising
from the N-th power map discussed above to glue together
†G †R⊇(†R◃)N∼
← ‡R◃⊆‡R ‡G
... where the notion of a gluing may be understood
·as a quotient set via identifications, or (preferably!)
·as an abstract diagram (cf. graphs of groups/anabelioids!)
the ring †R to the ring ‡R along the multiplicative monoids
(†R◃)N∼
←‡R◃(with group actions). This gluing is compatible
with the resp. actions of †G,
‡G relative to the isomorphism
†G∼
→‡G given by forgetting the labels “†”, “‡”, but, since the
N-th power map is not compatible with addition (!), this isom.
†G∼
→‡G may be regarded either as an isom. of (“coric”, i.e.,
invariant w.r.t. the N-th power map) abstract groups (cf. the
notion of “inter-universality”, as discussed in [EssLgc], §3.2,
§3.8!) or as an isomorphism of groups equipped with actions on
certain multiplicative monoids, but not as an isomorphism of
(“Galois” — cf. the inner automorphism indeterminacies of
SGA1!) groups equipped with actions on rings/fields.
FORMALIZATION OF IUT: PRELIMINARY PROGRESS REPORT 7
·The problem of describing (certain portions of the) ring structure
of †R in terms of the ring structure of ‡R — in a fashion that
is compatible with the gluing and via a single algorithm that may
be applied to the common (cf. logical AND ∧!) glued data to re-
construct simultaneously (certain portions of) the ring structures
of both †Rand ‡R, up to suitable relatively mild indeterminacies
(cf. the theory of crystals!) — seems (at first glance/in general)
to be hopelessly intractable (cf. the case of Z)!
... where we note that here, considering portions is
important because we want to decompose the above
diagram up into pieces so that we can consider
symmetry properties involving these pieces!
One well-known elementary example: when N= p, working
modulo p (cf. indeterminacies, analogy with crystals!), where
there is a common ring structure that is compatible with the
p-th power map!
Another important example: Faltings’ proof of invariance of
height of elliptic curves under isogeny, under the assumption
of the existence of a global multiplicative subspace (cf. [ClsIUT],
§1; [EssLgc], Example 3.2.1)!
... This is precisely what is achieved in IUT by means of the
multiradial representation for the Θ-pilot via
·anabelian geometry (cf. the abstract groups †G,
‡G!);
·the p-adic/complex logarithm, Galois eval. of theta functions;
·Kummer theory, to relate Frob.-/´etale-like versions of objects.
· Main point:
The multiplicative monoid and abstract group structures (but not
the ring structures!) are common (cf. “logical AND ∧!”) to †, ‡
and can be used as the input data for an algorithm to construct
the multiradial representation for the Θ-pilot, i.e., a common
container for the distinct ring strs. (i.e., “arith. hol. strs.”) †, ‡
†R ⊆ multirad. rep. for the Θ-pilot ⊇ ‡R
· When R= Z (or, in fact, more generally, the ring of integers
“OF ” of a number field F — cf. the multiplicative norm map
NF/Q : F →Q), one may consider the “height/log-volume”
log(|x|) ∈R
for 0 ̸= x∈Z. Then the N-th power map of (i), (ii) corresponds,
after passing to heights, to multiplying real numbers by N; the
multiradial algorithm corresponds to saying that the height is
unaﬀected (up to a mild error term!) by multiplication by N,
hence that the height is bounded!
8 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI (RIMS, KYOTO UNIVERSITY)
· In the case of IUT, the multirad. rep. for the Θ-pilot is obtained by
means of a sort of “analytic continuation” along a certain “infinite H”
of the log-theta-lattice (cf. the discussion surrounding [EssLgc], §3.3,
(InfH))

— which involves a gradual introduction via “descent” operations of
“fuzzifications”, corresponding to indeterminacies (cf. the discussion
of [EssLgc], §3.10).
· At a more technical level, the multirad. rep. for the Θ-pilot is obtained by
constructing invariants with respects to the log-link, which has the eﬀect
of juggling addition and multiplication— i.e., juggling the dilated and
non-dilated portions of the ring strs.— and, as a result, eﬀects a sort of
“miraculous rotation” (the discussion of [EssLgc], §3.11)

§4. Skeletal Lean code for “3.11.5= ⇒ 3.12”
· The significance of the multiradial representation lies in the fact
that it expresses — by means of the technique of descent (cf. the
final portion of §3) — the Θ-pilot (i.e., in essence, the image of
the N-th power map) in the domain of the Θ-link (i.e., in essence,
the N-th power map) in terms of purely group-theoretic data —
called the etHT (i.e., “´etale Hodge theater”) — that is vertically
coric (i.e., invariant with respect to the log-link) and (unlike the
Θ-link/N-th power map x→xN !!) is symmetric

[IUTchI-IV], “F ×µ-prime-strip”), of the Θ-link fixed.
10 BPS SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI (RIMS, KYOTO UNIVERSITY)
· The theory surrounding this operation of descent is summarized
in the first two commuting triangles (i.e., “ △”) of the follow-
ing diagram of species (i.e., boxes) and mutations (i.e., arrows):

That is to say:
·the first △ expresses the multiradial algorithm — whose input
is a BPS, and whose output is the multiradial representation—
as an algorithm whose input may be thought of as a BPS glued
(via a “full poly-isomorphism”, i.e., an arbitrary indeterminate
isomorphism) to the underlying BPS of the Θ-pilot (at (0,0))
arising from the 0-column of the log-theta-lattice, where we re-
call that the multiradial representation is constructed as a sort
of quotient of the 0-column, by regarding it up to suitable inde-
terminacies (Ind1,2,3);
·the second △ expresses — via the “descent-arrow (dsc)” —
the descent aspect of the multiradial representation, i.e., that
if one works up to the indeterminacies (Ind1,2,3), then one may
regard the multiradial representation as an object that is con-
structed from weaker data — namely, a BPS whose “´etale-like”
(i.e., group-theoretic) portion is glued (via a “full poly-isomor-
phism”, i.e., an arbitrary indeterminate isomorphism) to the
corresponding portion of the (vertically coric!) etHT associated
to the 0-column of the log-theta-lattice;
·the third △ simply expresses the definition of the composite
arrow (HDD) := (hull+det)◦(dsc) obtained by composing the
descent-arrow (dsc) (cf. the second △!) with a certain elemen-
tary operation “hull+det” (obtained essentially by taking the
determinant of the module over a ring generated by a certain
topological module that appears in the multiradial representa-
tion);
·the fourth △ expresses the composite (HDD)◦(SHE) that is
obtained by restricting the arrow (HDD) (cf. the third △!) to
the special case where the input data “BPS+etHT” of (HDD)
is taken — by applying the “SHE-arrow (SHE)”, where “SHE”
stands for simultaneous holomorphic expressibility — to be the
data given by the q-pilot constructed from the etHT (i.e., in
essence, the data in the domain of the N-th power map).
FORMALIZATION OF IUT: PRELIMINARY PROGRESS REPORT · The skeletal Lean code that was referred to in the discussion of
11
§1 concerns the the fourth △ of the preceding diagram, i.e., the
simultaneous comparison relative to a single ring structure (cf.
the discussion of a “common container” in §3) of
·the Θ-pilot — which corresponds to (HDD), or, alternatively,
to the image of the N-th power map — and
·the q-pilot — which corresponds to (SHE), or, alternatively, to
to the domain of the N-th power map.
We chose to concentrate on this aspect of the theory first since
this aspect of the theory — i.e., “Stage 1: [IUTchIII] Theorem
3.11 = ⇒ Corollary 3.12” (cf. the discussion at the beginning
of §2) — has received the most public attention. Indeed, this as-
pect corresponds to the essential nontrivial content of the theory,
i.e., that the height of the elliptic curve under consideration is
equal to N times the height of the elliptic curve (where N is a
large positive number), up to a small discrepancy (arising from
(Ind1,2,3) + hull), thus implying a bound on the height.
· In fact, the fourth △ corresponds to the final portion of a certain
reorganization/decomposition of the implication “3.11 = ⇒ 3.12”
into several portions, which correspond to the four △discussed
above. We shall refer to this final portion as “3.11.5 = ⇒ 3.12”
(although in fact “3.11.5 (=3.11+Rmk. 3.9.5)” never appears in
[IUTchI-IV]!). At a more technical level, this reorgan./decomp.
is obtained by “moving” the “hull+det” in 3.12 to “3.11.5”, thus
making it possible to concentrate, in “3.11.5 = ⇒ 3.12”, on the
crucial simultaneous comparison aspect of 3.12 discussed above.
This aspect also involves the input prime-strip link (IPL) proper-
ty, which refers to the relationship between the data contained
in the input BPS of the multiradial algorithm and the data con-
tained in the output of the multiradial algorithm. In fact, IPL
also plays an important role in the implication “3.11 = ⇒3.11.5”,
i.e., which corresponds to the first/second/third △. The central
aspect of the (slightly nontrivial, by comparison to the first △)
second/third △ lies in the algorithmic parallel transport (APT)
property, which concerns the way in which “gluings up to inde-
terminacies” (such as (Ind1,2,3) + hull) are expressed. Our re-
search group at RIMS is currently making substantial progress
with regard to writing skeletal Lean code for the second/third △
that formalizes the APT aspect of the theory.
