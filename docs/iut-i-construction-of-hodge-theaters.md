INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I:
CONSTRUCTION OF HODGE THEATERS
Shinichi Mochizuki
May 2020
Abstract. The present paper is the first in a series of four papers, the
goal of which is to establish an arithmetic version of Teichm¨ uller theory for number
fields equipped with an elliptic curve — which we refer to as “inter-universal
Teichm¨ uller theory” — by applying the theory of semi-graphs of anabelioids,
Frobenioids, the´ etale theta function, and log-shells developed in earlier papers by
the author. We begin by fixing what we call “initial Θ-data”, which consists of
an elliptic curve EF over a number field F , and a prime number l ≥ 5, as well as
some other technical data satisfying certain technical properties. This data deter-
mines various hyperbolic orbicurves that are related via finite ´ etale coverings to the
once-punctured elliptic curve XF determined by EF . These finite ´ etale coverings
admit various symmetry properties arising from the additive and multiplicative
structures on the ring Fl = Z/lZ acting on the l-torsion points of the elliptic curve.
We then construct “Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters” associated to the given Θ-data. These
Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters may be thought of as miniature models of conventional
scheme theory in which the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a
number field — which may be thought of as corresponding to the additive and
multiplicative structures of a ring or, alternatively, to the group of units and
value group of a local field associated to the number field — are, in some sense,
“dismantled” or “disentangled” from one another. All Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters
are isomorphic to one another, but may also be related to one another by means of a
“Θ-link”, which relates certain Frobenioid-theoretic portions of one Θ±ellNF-Hodge
theater to another in a fashion that is not compatible with the respective conven-
tional ring/scheme theory structures. In particular, it is a highly nontrivial
problem to relate the ring structures on either side of the Θ-link to one another. This
will be achieved, up to certain “relatively mild indeterminacies”, in future papers
in the series by applying the absolute anabelian geometry developed in earlier
papers by the author. The resulting description of an “alien ring structure” [asso-
ciated, say, to the domain of the Θ-link] in terms of a given ring structure [associated,
say, to the codomain of the Θ-link] will be applied in the final paper of the series to
obtain results in diophantine geometry. Finally, we discuss certain technical results
concerning profinite conjugates of decomposition and inertia groups in the tem-
pered fundamental group of a p-adic hyperbolic curve that will be of use in the
development of the theory of the present series of papers, but are also of independent
interest.

§I1. Summary of Main Results
The present paper is the first in a series of four papers, the goal of which is
to establish an arithmetic version of Teichm¨ uller theory for number fields
equipped with an elliptic curve, by applying the theory of semi-graphs of anabe-
lioids, Frobenioids, the´ etale theta function, and log-shells developed in [SemiAnbd],
[FrdI], [FrdII], [EtTh], and [AbsTopIII] [cf., especially, [EtTh] and [AbsTopIII]].
Unlike many mathematical papers, which are devoted to verifying properties of
mathematical objects that are either well-known or easily constructed from well-
known mathematical objects, in the present series of papers, most of our eﬀorts
will be devoted to constructing new mathematical objects. It is only in the final
portion of the third paper in the series, i.e., [IUTchIII], that we turn to the task of
proving properties of interest concerning the mathematical objects constructed. In
the fourth paper of the series, i.e., [IUTchIV], we show that these properties may
be combined with certain elementary computations to obtain diophantine results
concerning elliptic curves over number fields.
We refer to §0 below for more on the notations and conventions applied in the
present series of papers. The starting point of our constructions is a collection of
initial Θ-data[cf. Definition3.1]. Roughlyspeaking,thisdataconsists,essentially,
of
· an elliptic curve EF over a number field F,
· an algebraic closure F of F,
· a prime number l ≥5,
· a collection of valuations V of a certain subfield K ⊆F, and
· a collection of valuations Vbad
mod of a certain subfield Fmod ⊆F
thatsatisfycertaintechnicalconditions—werefertoDefinition3.1formoredetails.
Here, we write Fmod ⊆F for the field of moduli of EF, K ⊆F for the extension field
of F determined by the l-torsion points of EF, XF ⊆EF for the once-punctured
elliptic curve obtained by removing the origin from EF, and XF →CF for the
hyperbolic orbicurve obtained by forming the stack-theoretic quotient of XF by the

natural action of {±1}. Then F is assumed to be Galois over Fmod, Gal(K/F)
is assumed to be isomorphic to a subgroup of GL2(Fl) that contains SL2(Fl), EF
is assumed to have stable reduction at all of the nonarchimedean valuations of F,
def
CK

is assumed to be a collection of valuations of K such that the natural inclusion
Fmod ⊆F ⊆K induces a bijection V∼
→Vmod between V and the set Vmod of all
valuations of the number field Fmod, and
Vbad
mod ⊆ Vmod
is assumed to be some nonempty set of nonarchimedean valuations of odd residue
characteristic over which EF has bad [i.e., multiplicative] reduction — i.e., roughly
speaking, the subset of the set of valuations where EF has bad multiplicative reduc-
tion that will be “of interest” to us in the context of the theory of the present series
of papers. Then we shall write Vbad def

This data determines, up to K-isomorphism [cf. Remark 3.1.3], a finite ´ etale
covering CK →CK of degree l such that the base-changed covering

Moreover, the above data also determines a cusp

of CK which, at v ∈Vbad, corresponds to the canonical generator, up to ±1, of Q
[i.e., the generator determined by the unique loop of the dual graph of the special
fiber]. Furthermore, at v ∈Vbad, one obtains a natural finite ´ etale covering of

[cf. the discussion at the beginning of §4; Definitions 6.1, 6.4] will play an important
role in the discussion to follow. The natural action of the stabilizer in Gal(K/F) of
the quotient EK[l] Q on Q determines a natural poly-action of Fl on CK, i.e.,
a natural isomorphism of Fl with some subquotient of Aut(CK) [cf. Example 4.3,
(iv)]. The Fl -symmetry constituted by this poly-action of Fl may be thought
of as being essentially arithmetic in nature, in the sense that the subquotient of
Aut(CK) that gives rise to this poly-action of Fl is induced, via the natural map
Aut(CK) →Aut(K), by a subquotient of Gal(K/F) ⊆Aut(K). In a similar vein,
the natural action of the automorphisms of the scheme XK on the cusps of XK
determines a natural poly-action of F ±
l on XK, i.e., a natural isomorphism of F ±
l
with some subquotient of Aut(XK) [cf. Definition 6.1, (v)]. The F ±
l -symmetry
constituted by this poly-action of F ±
l may be thought of as being essentially geo-
metric in nature, in the sense that the subgroup AutK(XK) ⊆Aut(XK) [i.e., of
K-linear automorphisms] maps isomorphically onto the subquotient of Aut(XK)
that gives rise to this poly-action of F ±
l . On the other hand, the global Fl-
symmetry of CK only extends to a “{1}-symmetry” [i.e., in essence, fails to extend!]
of the local coverings X
v [for v ∈Vbad] and X
− →v [for v ∈Vgood], while the global
F ±
l -symmetry of XK only extends to a “{±1}-symmetry” [i.e., in essence, fails to
extend!] of the local coverings X
v [for v ∈Vbad] and X
− →v [for v ∈Vgood] — cf. Fig.

We shall write Πv for the tempered fundamental group of X
v, when v ∈Vbad
[cf. Definition 3.1, (e)]; we shall write Πv for the´ etale fundamental group of X
− →v,
when v ∈Vgood [cf. Definition 3.1, (f)]. Also, for v ∈Vnon, we shall write Πv Gv
forthequotientdeterminedbytheabsolute Galois groupofthebasefieldKv. Often,
in the present series of papers, we shall consider various types of collections of data
— which we shall refer to as “prime-strips” — indexed by v ∈V (∼
→Vmod) that
are isomorphic to certain data that arise naturally from X
v [when v ∈Vbad] or X
− →v
[when v ∈Vgood]. The main types of prime-strips that will be considered in the
present series of papers are summarized in Fig. I1.2 below.
Perhaps the most basic kind of prime-strip is a D-prime-strip. When v ∈
Vnon, the portion of a D-prime-strip labeled by v is given by a category equivalent
to [the full subcategory determined by the connected objects of] the category of
tempered coverings of X
v [when v ∈Vbad] or finite ´ etale coverings of X
− →v [when
v ∈Vgood]. When v ∈Varc, an analogous definition may be obtained by applying

associated to Gv; when v ∈Varc, an analogous definition may be given. In some
sense, D-prime-strips may be thought of as abstractions of the “local arithmetic
holomorphic structure” of [copies of] Fmod [which we regard as equipped with
the once-punctured elliptic curve XF] — cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I3. On
the other hand, D⊢-prime-strips may be thought of as “mono-analyticizations”
[i.e., roughly speaking, the arithmetic version of the underlying real analytic struc-
tureassociatedtoaholomorphicstructure]ofD-prime-strips—cf. thediscussionof
[AbsTopIII], §I3. Throughout the present series of papers, we shall use the notation
⊢
to denote mono-analytic structures.
Next, we recall the notion of a Frobenioid over a base category [cf. [FrdI]
for more details]. Roughly speaking, a Frobenioid [typically denoted “F”] may
be thought of as a category-theoretic abstraction of the notion of a category of
line bundles or monoids of divisors over a base category [typically denoted “D”]
of topological localizations [i.e., in the spirit of a “topos”] such as a Galois cate-
gory. In addition to D- and D⊢-prime-strips, we shall also consider various types
of prime-strips that arise from considering various natural Frobenioids — i.e., more
concretely, various natural monoids equipped with a Galois action — at v ∈V. Per-
haps the most basic type of prime-strip arising from such a natural monoid is an
F-prime-strip. Suppose, for simplicity, that v ∈Vbad. Then v and F determine,
up to conjugacy, an algebraic closure Fv of Kv. Write
· OFv
for the ring of integers of Fv;
· O◃
Fv
⊆OFv
for the multiplicative monoid of nonzero integers;
· O×
Fv
⊆OFv
for the multiplicative monoid of units;
· Oμ
Fv
⊆OFv
for the multiplicative monoid of roots of unity;
· Oμ2l
Fv
⊆OFv
for the multiplicative monoid of 2l-th roots of unity;
· q
∈OFv
for a 2l-th root of the q-parameter of EF at v.
v
Thus, OFv
, O◃
, O×
, Oμ
, and Oμ2l
are equipped with natural Gv-actions. The
Fv
Fv
Fv
Fv
portion of an F-prime-strip labeled by v is given by data isomorphic to the monoid
O◃
, equipped with its natural Πv ( Gv)-action [cf. Fig. I1.2]. There are various
Fv
mono-analytic versions of the notion of an F-prime-strip; perhaps the most basic
is the notion of an F⊢-prime-strip. The portion of an F⊢-prime-strip labeled by
v is given by data isomorphic to the monoid O×
×qN
, equipped with its natural
Fv
v
Gv-action [cf. Fig. I1.2]. Often we shall regard these various mono-analytic ver-
sions of an F-prime-strip as being equipped with an additional global realified
Frobenioid, which, at a concrete level, corresponds, essentially, to considering var-
ious arithmetic degrees ∈R at v ∈V (∼
→Vmod) that are related to one another by
means of the product formula. Throughout the present series of papers, we shall
use the notation

Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater †HTΘ±ellNF, one may associate a D-Θ±ellNF-Hodge the-
ater [cf. Definition 6.13, (ii)]
†HTD-Θ±ellNF
— i.e., the associated system of base categories.
One may think of a Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater †HTΘ±ellNF as the result of gluing
together a Θ±ell-Hodge theater †HTΘ±ell
to a ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTΘNF [cf. Re-
mark 6.12.2, (ii)]. In a similar vein, one may think of a D-Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater
†HTD-Θ±ellNF as the result of gluing together a D-Θ±ell-Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ell
to a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTD-ΘNF. A D-Θ±ell-Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ell
may
be thought of as a bookkeeping device that allows one to keep track of the action
of the F ±
l -symmetry on the labels
(−l < ... <−1 < 0 < 1 < ... < l )
— which we think of as elements ∈Fl — in the context of the [orbi]curves XK,
X
v [for v ∈Vbad], and X
− →v [for v ∈Vgood]. The F ±
l -symmetry is represented in a
D-Θ±ell-Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ell by a category equivalent to [the full subcategory
determined by the connected objects of] the Galois category of finite´ etale coverings
of XK. On the other hand, each of the labels referred to above is represented in
a D-Θ±ell-Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ell
by a D-prime-strip. In a similar vein, a
D-ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTD-ΘNF may be thought of as a bookkeeping device that
allows one to keep track of the action of the Fl -symmetry on the labels
(1 < ... < l )
— which we think of as elements ∈Fl — in the context of the orbicurves CK,
X
v [for v ∈Vbad], and X
− →v [for v ∈Vgood]. The Fl -symmetry is represented in a
D-ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTD-ΘNF by a category equivalent to [the full subcategory
determined by the connected objects of] the Galois category of finite´ etale coverings
of CK. On the other hand, each of the labels referred to above is represented in a D-
ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTD-ΘNF by a D-prime-strip. The combinatorial structure
of D-ΘNF- and D-Θ±ell-Hodge theaters summarized above [cf. also Fig. I1.3 below]
is one of the main topics of the present paper and is discussed in detail in §4 and
§6. The left-hand portion of Fig. I1.3 corresponds to the D-Θ±ell-Hodge theater;
the right-hand portion of Fig. I1.3 corresponds to the D-ΘNF-Hodge theater; these
left-hand and right-hand portions are glued together by identifying D-prime-strips
in such a way that the labels 0 ̸= ±t ∈ Fl on the left are identified with the
corresponding label j ∈Fl on the right [cf. Proposition 6.7; Remark 6.12.2; Fig.
6.5].
In this context, we remark that many of the constructions of [AbsTopIII] were
intended as prototypes for constructions of the present series of papers. For in-
stance, the global theory of [AbsTopIII], §5, was intended as a sort of simplified
prototype for the Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters of the present paper, i.e., except with
the various label bookkeeping devices deleted. The various panalocal objects of [Ab-
sTopIII], §5, were intended as prototypes for the various types of prime-strips that
8 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
appear in the present series of papers. Perhaps most importantly, the theory of the
log-Frobenius functor and log-shells developed in [AbsTopIII], §3, §4, §5, was in-
tended as a prototype for the theory of the log-link that is developed in [IUTchIII].
In particular, although most of the main ideas and techniques of [AbsTopIII],
§3, §4, §5, will play an important role in the present series of papers, many of the
constructions performed in [AbsTopIII], §3, §4, §5, will not be applied in a direct,
literal sense in the present series of papers.
The F ±
l -symmetry has the advantange that, being geometric in nature, it
allows one to permute various copies of “Gv” [where v ∈Vnon] associated to dis-
tinct labels ∈Fl without inducing conjugacy indeterminacies. This phenomenon,
which we shall refer to as conjugate synchronization, will play a key role in
the Kummer theory surrounding the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the
theta function at l-torsion points that is developed in [IUTchII]— cf. the dis-
cussion of Remark 6.12.6; [IUTchII], Remark 3.5.2, (ii), (iii); [IUTchII], Remark
4.5.3, (i). By contrast, the Fl -symmetry is more suited to situations in which one
must descend from K to Fmod. In the present series of papers, the most important
such situation involves the Kummer theory surrounding the reconstruction of
the number field Fmod from the ´ etale fundamental group of CK — cf. the dis-
cussion of Remark 6.12.6; [IUTchII], Remark 4.7.6. This reconstruction will be
discussed in Example 5.1 of the present paper. Here, we note that such situations
necessarily induce global Galois permutations of the various copies of “Gv” [where
v ∈Vnon] associated to distinct labels ∈Fl that are only well-defined up to con-
jugacy indeterminacies. In particular, the Fl -symmetry is ill-suited to situations,
such as those that appear in the theory of Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation that
is developed in [IUTchII], that require one to establish conjugate synchronization.

[cf. Figs. 4.4, 4.7, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5 for more details]
Ultimately, when, in [IUTchIV], we consider diophantine applications of the
theory developed in the present series of papers, we will take the prime number
l to be “large”, i.e., roughly of the order of the square root of the height of the
elliptic curve EF [cf. [IUTchIV], Corollary 2.2, (ii), (C1)]. When l is regarded as
large, the arithmetic of the finite field Fl “tends to approximate” the arithmetic of
the ring of rational integers Z. That is to say, the decomposition that occurs in
a Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater into the “additive” [i.e., F ±
l -] and “multiplicative” [i.e.,
Fl -] symmetries of the ring Fl may be regarded as a sort of rough, approximate
approach to the issue of “disentangling” the multiplicative and additive struc-
tures, i.e., “dismantling” the “two underlying combinatorial dimensions” [cf.
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 9
the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I3], of the ring Z — cf. the discussion of Remarks
6.12.3, 6.12.6.
Alternatively, this decomposition into additive and multiplicative symmetries
in the theory of Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters may be compared to groups of addi-
tive and multiplicative symmetries of the upper half-plane [cf. Fig. I1.4
below]. Here, the “cuspidal” geometry expressed by the additive symmetries of
the upper half-plane admits a natural “associated coordinate”, namely, the clas-
sical q-parameter, which is reminiscent of the way in which the F ±
l -symmetry
is well-adapted to the Kummer theory surrounding the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation of the theta function at l-torsion points [cf. the above discussion].
By contrast, the “toral”, or “nodal” [cf. the classical theory of the structure of
Hecke correspondences modulo p], geometry expressed by the multiplicative sym-
metries of the upper half-plane admits a natural “associated coordinate”, namely,
theclassicalbiholomorphicisomorphismoftheupperhalf-planewiththeunit disc,
which is reminiscent of the way in which the Fl -symmetry is well-adapted to the
Kummer theory surrounding the number field Fmod [cf. the above discussion].
For more details, we refer to the discussion of Remark 6.12.3, (iii).
From the point of view of the scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory devel-
opedin[HASurI],[HASurII],thetheoryofthecombinatorial structureofaΘ±ellNF-
Hodge theater — and, indeed, the theory of the present series of papers! — may
be regarded as a sort of
solution to the problem of constructing “global multiplicative sub-
spaces” and “global canonical generators” [cf. the quotient“Q” and
the cusp “ϵ” that appear in the above discussion!]
— the nonexistence of which in a “naive, scheme-theoretic sense” constitutes the
main obstruction to applying the theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] to diophantine
geometry [cf. the discussion of Remark 4.3.1]. Indeed, prime-strips may be
thought of as “local analytic sections” of the natural morphism Spec(K) →
Spec(Fmod). Thus, it is precisely by working with such “local analytic sections” —
i.e., more concretely, by working with the collection of valuations V, as opposed to
the set of all valuations of K — that one can, in some sense, “simulate” the notions
of a “global multiplicative subspace” or a “global canonical generator”. On the other
hand, such “simulated global objects” may only be achieved at the cost of
“dismantling”, or performing “surgery” on, the global prime struc-
ture of the number fields involved [cf. the discussion of Remark 4.3.1]
—aquitedrasticoperation, whichhastheeﬀectofprecipitatingnumerous technical
diﬃculties, whose resolution, via the theory of semi-graphs of anabelioids, Frobe-
nioids, the´ etale theta function, and log-shells developed in [SemiAnbd], [FrdI],
[FrdII], [EtTh], and [AbsTopIII], constitutes the bulk of the theory of the present
series of papers! From the point of view of “performing surgery on the global prime
structure of a number field”, the labels ∈Fl that appear in the “arithmetic”
Fl -symmetry may be thought of as a sort of “miniature finite approxima-
tion” of this global prime structure, in the spirit of the idea of “Hodge theory at
finite resolution” discussed in [HASurI], §1.3.4. On the other hand, the labels ∈Fl
that appear in the “geometric” F ±

of “miniature finite approximation” of the natural tempered Z-coverings [i.e.,
tempered coverings with Galois group Z] of the Tate curves determined by EF at
v ∈Vbad, again in the spirit of the idea of “Hodge theory at finite resolution”
discussed in [HASurI], §1.3.4.

at v ∈Vbad, and, roughly speaking, extending to v ∈Vgood in such a way as to
satisfy the product formula, one may construct a natural F -prime-strip“Fmod
”
[cf. Example 3.5, (ii); Definition 5.2, (iv)]. This construction admits an abstract,
algorithmic formulation that allows one to apply it to the underlying“Θ-Hodge
theater” of an arbitrary Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater †HTΘ±ellNF so as to obtain an F-
prime-strip
†Fmod
[cf. Definitions 3.6, (c); 5.2, (iv)]. On the other hand, by formally replacing the
2l-th roots of the q-parameters that appear in this construction by the reciprocal
of the l-th root of the Frobenioid-theoretic theta function, which we shall denote
“Θ
v” [for v ∈Vbad], studied in [EtTh] [cf. also Example 3.2, (ii), of the present
paper], one obtains an abstract, algorithmic formulation for the construction of an
F -prime-strip
†Ftht
[cf. Definitions 3.6, (c); 5.2, (iv)] from [the underlying Θ-Hodge theater of] the
Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater †HTΘ±ellNF
.
Now let ‡HTΘ±ellNF be another Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater [relative to the given
initial Θ-data]. Then we shall refer to the “full poly-isomorphism” of [i.e., the
collection of all isomorphisms between] F -prime-strips
†Ftht
∼
→ ‡Fmod
as the Θ-link from [the underlying Θ-Hodge theater of] †HTΘ±ellNF to [the under-
lying Θ-Hodge theater of] ‡HTΘ±ellNF [cf. Corollary 3.7, (i); Definition 5.2, (iv)].
One fundamental property of the Θ-link is the property that it induces a collection
of isomorphisms [in fact, the full poly-isomorphism] between the F⊢×-prime-strips
†F⊢×
mod
∼
→ ‡F⊢×
mod
associated to †Fmod and ‡Fmod [cf. Corollary 3.7, (ii), (iii); [IUTchII], Definition
4.9, (vii)].
Now let {nHTΘ±ellNF}n∈Z be a collection of distinct Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters
[relative to the given initial Θ-data] indexed by the integers. Thus, by applying the
constructions just discussed, we obtain an infinite chain

of Θ-linked Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters [cf. Corollary 3.8], which will be re-
ferred to as the Frobenius-picture [associated to the Θ-link]. One fundamen-
tal property of this Frobenius-picture is the property that it fails to admit per-
mutation automorphisms that switch adjacent indices n, n + 1, but leave the
remaining indices ∈ Z fixed [cf. Corollary 3.8]. Roughly speaking, the Θ-link
nHTΘ±ellNF Θ

In fact, the Θ-link discussed in the present paper is only a simplified version
ofthe“Θ-link”thatwillultimatelyplayacentralroleinthepresentseriesofpapers.
The construction of the version of the Θ-link that we shall ultimately be interested
in is quite technically involved and, indeed, occupies the greater part of the theory
to be developed in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]. On the other hand, the simplified version
discussed in the present paper is of interest in that it allows one to give a relatively
straightforward introduction to many of the important qualitative properties of
the Θ-link — such as the Frobenius-picture discussed above and the´ etale-picture
to be discussed below — that will continue to be of central importance in the case
of the versions of the Θ-link that will be developed in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII].

core”—ofthevariousΘ±ellNF-HodgetheatersthatoccurintheFrobenius-picture

the relationships of the various D-Θ±ellNF-Hodge theatersnHTD-Θ±ellNF to this
mono-analytic core — relationships that are depicted by spokes in Fig. I1.6 below
— are compatible with arbitrary permutation symmetries among the spokes
[i.e., among the labels n ∈Z of the D-Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters] — cf. Corollaries

Etale-picture of D-Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters
Before proceeding, we recall the “heuristic” notions of Frobenius-like — i.e.,
“order-conscious” — and´ etale-like — i.e., “indiﬀerent to order”— mathematical
structures discussed in [FrdI], §I4. These notions will play a key role in the theory
developed in the present series of papers. In particular, the terms “Frobenius-
picture” and “´ etale-picture” introduced above are motivated by these notions.
The main result of the present paper may be summarized as follows.
Theorem A. (F ±
l -/Fl -Symmetries, Θ-Links, and Frobenius-/´
Etale-Pic-
tures Associated to Θ±ellNF-Hodge Theaters) Fix a collection of initial Θ-
data [cf. Definition 3.1], which determines, in particular, data (EF, F, l, V) as
in the above discussion. Then one may construct a Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater [cf.
Definition 6.13, (i)]
†HTΘ±ellNF
— in essence, a system of Frobenioids — associated to this initial Θ-data, as well as
an associated D-Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ellNF [cf. Definition 6.13, (ii)]
14 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
— in essence, the system of base categories associated to the system of Frobenioids
†HTΘ±ellNF
.
(i) (F ±
l - and Fl -Symmetries) The Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater †HTΘ±ellNF
may be obtained as the result of gluing together a Θ±ell-Hodge theater †HTΘ±ell
to
a ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTΘNF [cf. Remark 6.12.2, (ii)]; a similar statement holds
for the D-Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ellNF. The global portion of a D-Θ±ell
-
Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ell consists of a category equivalent to [the full subcategory
determined by the connected objects of] the Galois category of finite ´ etale coverings
of the [orbi]curve XK. This global portion is equipped with an F ±
l -symmetry,
i.e., a poly-action by F ±
l on the labels
(−l < ... <−1 < 0 < 1 < ... < l )
— which we think of as elements ∈Fl — each of which is represented in the D-
Θ±ell-Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ell
by a D-prime-strip [cf. Fig. I1.3]. The global
portion of a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTD-ΘNF consists of a category equivalent to
[the full subcategory determined by the connected objects of] the Galois category of
finite ´ etale coverings of the orbicurve CK. This global portion is equipped with an
Fl -symmetry, i.e., a poly-action by Fl on the labels
(1 < ... < l )
— which we think of as elements ∈ Fl — each of which is represented in the
D-ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTD-ΘNF by a D-prime-strip [cf. Fig. I1.3]. The D-
Θ±ell-Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ell
is glued to the D-ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTD-ΘNF
by identifying D-prime-strips in such a way that the labels 0 ̸= ±t ∈Fl that
arise in the F ±
l -symmetry are identified with the corresponding label j ∈Fl that
arises in the Fl -symmetry [cf. Proposition 6.7; Remark 6.12.2; Fig. 6.5].
(ii) (Θ-links) By considering the 2l-th roots of the q-parameters“q
” of
v
the elliptic curve EF at v ∈Vbad and extending to other v ∈V in such a way as
to satisfy the product formula, one may construct a natural F -prime-strip
†Fmod associated to the Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater †HTΘ±ellNF [cf. Definitions 3.6,
(c); 5.2, (iv)]. In a similar vein, by considering the reciprocal of the l-th root
of the Frobenioid-theoretic theta function “Θ
v” associated to the elliptic curve
EF at v ∈Vbad and extending to other v ∈V in such a way as to satisfy the
product formula, one may construct a natural F -prime-strip †Ftht associated
to the Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater †HTΘ±ellNF [cf. Definitions 3.6, (c); 5.2, (iv)]. Now
let ‡HTΘ±ellNF be another Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater [relative to the given initial Θ-
data]. Then we shall refer to the “full poly-isomorphism” of [i.e., the collection of
all isomorphisms between] F -prime-strips
†Ftht
∼
→ ‡Fmod
as the Θ-link from [the underlying Θ-Hodge theater of] †HTΘ±ellNF to [the under-
lying Θ-Hodge theater of] ‡HTΘ±ellNF [cf. Corollary 3.7, (i); Definition 5.2, (iv)].

(iii) (Frobenius-/
Etale-Pictures) Let {nHTΘ±ellNF}n∈Z be a collection of
distinct Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters [relative to the given initial Θ-data] indexed
by the integers. Then the infinite chain

of Θ-linked Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters will be referred to as the Frobenius-
picture [associated to the Θ-link] — cf. Fig. I1.5; Corollary 3.8. The Frobenius-
picture fails to admit permutation automorphisms that switch adjacent indices
n, n+1, but leave the remaining indices ∈Z fixed. The Frobenius-picture induces

depicted by spokes in Fig. I1.6 — are compatible with arbitrary permutation
symmetries among the spokes, i.e., among the labels n ∈Z of the D-Θ±ellNF-
Hodge theaters [cf. Corollaries 4.12, (ii), 6.10, (i)]. The diagram depicted in Fig.
I1.6 will be referred to as the´ etale-picture.
In addition to the main result discussed above, we also prove a certain technical
result concerning tempered fundamental groups — cf. Theorem B below —
that will be of use in our development of the theory of Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation in [IUTchII]. This result is essentially a routine application of the the-
ory of maximal compact subgroups of tempered fundamental groups developed in
[SemiAnbd] [cf., especially, [SemiAnbd], Theorems 3.7, 5.4, as well as Remark 2.5.3,
(ii), of the present paper]. Here, we recall that this theory of [SemiAnbd] may be
thought of as a sort of “Combinatorial Section Conjecture” [cf. Remark 2.5.1
of the present paper; [IUTchII], Remark 1.12.4] — a point of view that is of particu-
lar interest in light of the historical remarks made in §I5 below. Moreover, Theorem
B is of interest independently of the theory of the present series of papers in that
it yields, for instance, a new proof of the normal terminality of the tempered fun-
damental group in its profinite completion, a result originally obtained in [Andr´ e],
Lemma 3.2.1, by means of other techniques [cf. Remark 2.4.1]. This new proof
is of interest in that, unlike the techniques of [Andr´ e], which are only available in
the profinite case, this new proof [cf. Proposition 2.4, (iii)] holds in the case of
pro-Σ-completions, for more general Σ [i.e., not just the case of Σ = Primes].
Theorem B. (Profinite Conjugates of Tempered Decomposition and
Inertia Groups) Let k be a mixed-characteristic [nonarchimedean] local
field, X a hyperbolic curve over k. Write
Πtp
X
16 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
for the tempered fundamental group πtp
1 (X) [relative to a suitable basepoint]
of X [cf. [Andr´ e], §4; [SemiAnbd], Example 3.10]; ΠX for the´ etale fundamental
group [relative to a suitable basepoint] of X. Thus, we have a natural inclusion
Πtp
X → ΠX
which allows one to identify ΠX with the profinite completion of Πtp
X. Then every
decomposition group in ΠX (respectively, inertia group in ΠX) associated to
a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a cusp of X) is contained in Πtp
X if
and only if it is a decomposition group in Πtp
X (respectively, inertia group in Πtp
X)
associated to a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a cusp of X). Moreover,
a ΠX-conjugate of Πtp
X contains a decomposition group in Πtp
X (respectively, inertia
group in Πtp
X) associated to a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a cusp of
X) if and only if it is equal to Πtp
X.
Theorem B is [essentially] given as Corollary 2.5 [cf. also Remark 2.5.2] in
§2. Here, we note that although, in the statement of Corollary 2.5, the hyperbolic
curve X is assumed to admit stable reduction over the ring of integers Ok of k, one
verifies immediately [by applying Proposition 2.4, (iii)] that this assumption is, in
fact, unnecessary.
Finally, we remark that one important reason for the need to apply Theorem B
in the context of the theory of Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters summarized in Theorem A
is the following. The F ±
l -symmetry, which will play a crucial role in the theory
of the present series of papers [cf., especially, [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]], depends, in an
essential way, on the synchronization of the ±-indeterminacies that occur locally
at each v ∈V [cf. Fig. I1.1]. Such a synchronization may only be obtained by
making use of the global portion of the Θ±ell-Hodge theater under consideration.
On the other hand, in order to avail oneself of such global ±-synchronizations
[cf. Remark 6.12.4, (iii)], it is necessary to regard the various labels of the F ±
l-
symmetry
(−l < ... <−1 < 0 < 1 < ... < l )
as conjugacy classes of inertia groups of the [necessarily] profinite geometric ´ etale
fundamental group of XK. That is to say, in order to relate such global profinite
conjugacy classes to the corresponding tempered conjugacy classes [i.e., conjugacy
classes with respect to the geometric tempered fundamental group] of inertia groups
at v ∈Vbad [i.e., where the crucial Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation is to be
performed!], it is necessary to apply Theorem B — cf. the discussion of Remark
4.5.1; [IUTchII], Remark 2.5.2, for more details.
§I2. Gluing Together Models of Conventional Scheme Theory
As discussed in §I1, the system of Frobenioids constituted by a Θ±ellNF-Hodge
theater is intended to be a sort of miniature model of conventional scheme the-
ory. One then glues multiple Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters {nHTΘ±ellNF}n∈Z together

to form the Frobenius-picture. One fundamental observation in this context is
the following:
these gluing isomorphisms — i.e., in essence, the correspondences
nΘ
v
→ (n+1)q
— and hence the geometry of the resulting Frobenius-picture lie outside
the framework of conventional scheme theory in the sense that they
do not arise from ring homomorphisms!
In particular, although each particular modelnHTΘ±ellNF of conventional scheme
theory is constructed within the framework of conventional scheme theory, the
relationship between the distinct [albeit abstractly isomorphic, as Θ±ellNF-Hodge
theaters!] conventional scheme theories represented by, for instance, neighboring
Θ±ellNF-Hodge theatersnHTΘ±ellNF

are possible precisely because of the relatively simple structure — for instance,
by comparison to the structure of a ring! — of the Frobenius-like structures

i.e., in essence, collections of monoids isomorphic to N or R≥0 [cf. Fig. I1.2].

18 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
If one thinks of the geometry of “conventional scheme theory” as being analo-
gous to the geometry of “Euclidean space”, then the geometry represented by the
Frobenius-picture corresponds to a “topological manifold”, i.e., which is obtained by
gluing together various portions of Euclidean space, but which is not homeomorphic
to Euclidean space. This point of view is illustrated in Fig. I2.1 above, where the
various Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters in the Frobenius-picture are depicted as [two-
dimensional! — cf. the discussion of §I1] twice-punctured topological surfaces
of genus one, glued together along tubular neighborhoods of cycles, which
correspond to the [one-dimensional! — cf. the discussion of §I1] mono-analytic
data that appears in the isomorphism that constitutes the Θ-link. The permuta-
tion symmetries in the ´ etale-picture [cf. the discussion of §I1] are depicted in Fig.
I2.1 as the anti-holomorphic reflection [cf. the discussion of multiradiality in
[IUTchII], Introduction!] around a gluing cycle between topological surfaces.
Another elementary example that illustrates the spirit of the gluing operations
discussed in the present series of papers is the following. For i = 0,1, let Ri be
a copy of the real line; Ii ⊆ Ri the closed unit interval [i.e., corresponding to
[0,1] ⊆R]. Write C0 ⊆I0 for the Cantor set and
φ : C0
∼
→I1
for the bijection arising from the Cantor function. Then if one thinks of R0 and
R1 as being glued to one another by means of φ, then it is a highly nontrivial
problem
to describe structures naturally associated to the “alien” ring structure
of R0 — such as, for instance, the subset of algebraic numbers ∈R0—
in terms that only require the use of the ring structure of R1.
A slightly less elementary example that illustrates the spirit of the gluing op-
erations discussed in the present series of papers is the following. This example is
technically much closer to the theory of the present series of papers than the exam-
ples involving topological surfaces and Cantor sets given above. For simplicity, let
us write
G O×, G O◃
for the pairs “Gv O×
”, “Gv O◃
” [cf. the notation of the discussion
Fv
Fv
surrounding Fig. I1.2]. Recall from [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iv), that the
operation
(G O◃) → G
of “forgetting O◃” determines a bijection from the group of automorphisms of the
pair G O◃ — i.e., thought of as an abstract ind-topological monoid equipped
with a continuous action by an abstract topological group — to the group of au-
tomorphisms of the topological group G. By contrast, we recall from [AbsTopIII],
Proposition 3.3, (ii), that the operation
(G O×) → G
of “forgetting O×” only determines a surjection from the group of automorphisms
of the pair G O× — i.e., thought of as an abstract ind-topological monoid
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 19
equipped with a continuous action by an abstract topological group — to the group
of automorphisms of the topological group G; that is to say, the kernel of this
surjection is given by the natural action of Z× on O×. In particular, if one works
with two copies Gi O◃
i , where i = 0,1, of G O◃, which one thinks of as being
glued to one another by means of an indeterminate isomorphism
(G0 O×
0 )∼
→ (G1 O×
1 )
[i.e., whereonethinksofeach(Gi O×
i ), fori = 0,1, asanabstractind-topological
monoid equipped with a continuous action by an abstract topological group], then,
in general, it is a highly nontrivial problem
to describe structures naturally associated to (G0 O◃
0 ) in terms that
only require the use of (G1 O◃
1 ).
One such structure which is of interest in the context of the present series of papers
[cf., especially, the theory of [IUTchII], §1] is the natural cyclotomic rigidity
isomorphism between the group of torsion elements of O◃
0 and an analogous
group of torsion elements naturally associated to G0 — i.e., a structure that is
manifestly not preserved by the natural action of Z× on O×
0 !
In the context of the above discussion of Fig. I2.1, it is of interest to note the
important role played by Kummer theory in the present series of papers [cf. the
Introductions to [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]]. From the point of view of Fig. I2.1, this
role corresponds to the precise specification of the gluing cycle within each twice-
punctured genus one surface in the illustration. Of course, such a precise specifi-
cation depends on the twice-punctured genus one surface under consideration, i.e.,
the same gluing cycle is subject to quite diﬀerent “precise specifications”, relative
to the twice-punctured genus one surface on the left and the twice-punctured genus
one surface on the right. This state of aﬀairs corresponds to the quite diﬀerent
Kummer theories to which the monoids/Frobenioids that appear in the Θ-link are
subject, relative to the Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater in the domain of the Θ-link and
the Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater in the codomain of the Θ-link. At first glance, it might
appear that the use of Kummer theory, i.e., of the correspondence determined by
constructing Kummer classes, to achieve this precise specification of the relevant
monoids/Frobenioids within each Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater is somewhat arbitrary,
i.e., that one could perhaps use other correspondences [i.e., correspondences not
determined by Kummer classes] to achieve such a precise specification. In fact,
however, the rigidity of the relevant local and global monoids equipped with Ga-
lois actions [cf. Corollary 5.3, (i), (ii), (iv)] implies that, if one imposes the natural
condition of Galois-compatibility, then
the correspondence furnished by Kummer theory is the only accept-
able choice for constructing the required“precise specification of the
relevant monoids/Frobenioids within each Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater”
— cf. also the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 3.6.2, (ii).
The construction of the Frobenius-picture described in §I1 is given in the
present paper. More elaborate versions of this Frobenius-picture will be discussed
in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]. Once one constructs the Frobenius-picture, one natural
20 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
and fundamental problem, which will, in fact, be one of the main themes of the
present series of papers, is the problem of
describing an alien “arithmetic holomorphic structure” [i.e., an
alien “conventional scheme theory”] corresponding to somemHTΘ±ellNF
in terms of a “known arithmetic holomorphic structure” corresponding to
nHTΘ±ellNF [where n ̸= m]
— a problem, which, as discussed in §I1, will be approached, in the final portion of
[IUTchIII], by applying various results from absolute anabelian geometry [i.e.,
more explicitly, the theory of [SemiAnbd], [EtTh], and [AbsTopIII]] to the various
tempered and ´ etale fundamental groups that appear in the´ etale-picture.
The relevance to this problem of the extensive theory of “reconstruction of
ring/scheme structures” provided by absolute anabelian geometry is evident from
the statement of the problem. On the other hand, in this context, it is of interest to
note that, unlike conventional anabelian geometry, which typically centers on the
goal of reconstructing a “known scheme-theoretic object”, in the present series of
papers, wewishtoapplytechniquesandresultsfromanabeliangeometryinorderto
analyze the structure of an unknown, essentially non-scheme-theoretic object,
namely, the Frobenius-picture, as described above. Put another way, relative
to the point of view that “Galois groups are arithmetic tangent bundles” [cf. the
theory of the arithmetic Kodaira-Spencer morphism in [HASurI]], one may think
of conventional anabelian geometry as corresponding to the computation of the
automorphisms of a scheme as
H0(arithmetic tangent bundle)
andoftheapplicationofabsoluteanabeliangeometrytotheanalysisoftheFrobenius-
picture, i.e., to the solution of the problem discussed above, as corresponding to
the computation of
H1(arithmetic tangent bundle)
— i.e., the computation of “deformations of the arithmetic holomorphic
structure” of a number field equipped with an elliptic curve.
In the context of the above discussion, we remark that the word “Hodge” in the
term “Hodge theater” was intended as a reference to the use of the word “Hodge”
in such classical terminology as “variation of Hodge structure” [cf. also the
discussion of Hodge filtrations in [AbsTopIII], §I5], for instance, in discussions of
Torelli maps [the most fundamental special case of which arises from the tautologi-
cal family of one-dimensional complex tori parametrized by the upper half-plane!],
where a “Hodge structure” corresponds precisely to the specification of a partic-
ular holomorphic structure in a situation in which one considers variations of the
holomorphic structure on a fixed underlying real analytic structure. That is to say,
later, in [IUTchIII], we shall see that the position occupied by a “Hodge theater”
within a much larger framework that will be referred to as the “log-theta-lattice” [cf.
the discussion of §I4 below] corresponds precisely to the specification of a partic-
ular arithmetic holomorphic structure in a situation in which such arithmetic
holomorphic structures are subject to deformation.

ULLER THEORY I 21
§I3. Basepoints and Inter-universality
As discussed in §I2, the present series of papers is concerned with considering
“deformations of the arithmetic holomorphic structure” of a number field — i.e., so
to speak, with performing “surgery on the number field”. At a more concrete
level, this means that one must consider situations in which two distinct “theaters”
for conventional ring/scheme theory — i.e., two distinct Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters
— are related to one another by means of a “correspondence”, or “filter”, that fails
to be compatible with the respective ring structures. In the discussion so far of
the portion of the theory developed in the present paper, the main example of such
a “filter” is given by the Θ-link. As mentioned earlier, more elaborate versions
of the Θ-link will be discussed in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]. The other main example
of such a non-ring/scheme-theoretic “filter” in the present series of papers is the
log-link, which we shall discuss in [IUTchIII] [cf. also the theory of [AbsTopIII]].
One important aspect of such non-ring/scheme-theoretic filters is the property
that they are incompatible with various constructions that depend on the ring
structure of the theaters that constitute the domain and codomain of such a filter.
From the point of view of the present series of papers, perhaps the most impor-
tant example of such a construction is given by the various´ etale fundamental
groups — e.g., Galois groups — that appear in these theaters. Indeed, these
groups are defined, essentially, as automorphism groups of some separably closed
field, i.e., the field that arises in the definition of the fiber functor associated to the
basepoint determined by a geometric point that is used to define the ´ etale fun-
damental group — cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 3.6.3, (i); [IUTchIII],
Remark 1.2.4, (i); [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.7.7, (i). In particular, unlike the case
with ring homomorphisms or morphisms of schemes with respect to which the ´ etale
fundamental group satisfies well-known functoriality properties, in the case of non-
ring/scheme-theoretic filters, the only “type of mathematical object” that makes
sense simultaneously in both the domain and codomain theaters of the filter is the
notion of a topological group. In particular, the only data that can be considered in
relating ´ etale fundamental groups on either side of a filter is the´ etale-like struc-
ture constituted by the underlying abstract topological group associated to
such an ´ etale fundamental group, i.e., devoid of any auxiliary data arising from the
construction of the group “as an ´ etale fundamental group associated to a base-
point determined by a geometric point of a scheme”. It is this fundamental aspect
of the theory of the present series of papers — i.e.,
of relating the distinct set-theoretic universes associated to the distinct
fiberfunctors/basepointsoneithersideofsuchanon-ring/scheme-theoretic
filter
— that we refer to as inter-universal. This inter-universal aspect of the theory
manifestly leads to the issue of considering
the extent to which one can understand various ring/scheme structures
by considering only the underlying abstract topological group of some
´ etale fundamental group arising from such a ring/scheme structure
— i.e., in other words, of considering the absolute anabelian geometry [cf. the
Introductions to [AbsTopI], [AbsTopII], [AbsTopIII]] of the rings/schemes under
consideration.
22 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
At this point, the careful reader will note that the above discussion of the
inter-universal aspects of the theory of the present series of papers depends, in
an essential way, on the issue of distinguishing diﬀerent “types of mathematical
objects”andhence, inparticular, onthenotion of a “type of mathematical object”.
This notion may be formalized via the language of “species”, which we develop
in the final portion of [IUTchIV].
Another important “inter-universal” phenomenon in the present series of pa-
pers—i.e., phenomenonwhich, liketheabsoluteanabelianaspectsdiscussedabove,
arises from a “deep sensitivity to particular choices of basepoints” — is the phe-
nomenon of conjugate synchronization, i.e., of synchronization between conju-
gacy indeterminacies of distinct copies of various local Galois groups, which, as was
mentioned in §I1, will play an important role in the theory of [IUTchII], [IUTchIII].
The various rigidity properties of the´ etale theta function established in [EtTh]
constitute yet another inter-universal phenomenon that will play an important role
in theory of [IUTchII], [IUTchIII].
§I4. Relation to Complex and p-adic Teichm¨ uller Theory
In order to understand the sense in which the theory of the present series
of papers may be thought of as a sort of “Teichm¨ uller theory” of number fields
equipped with an elliptic curve, it is useful to recall certain basic, well-known facts
concerning the classical complex Teichm¨ uller theory of Riemann surfaces of
finite type [cf., e.g., [Lehto], Chapter V, §8]. Although such a Riemann surface is
one-dimensional from a complex, holomorphic point of view, this single complex
dimension may be thought of consisting of two underlying real analytic dimensions.
Relative to a suitable canonical holomorphic coordinate z = x+iy on the Riemann
surface, the Teichm¨ uller deformation may be written in the form
z → ζ= ξ +iη= Kx+iy
— where 1 < K < ∞is the dilation factor associated to the deformation. That is
to say, the Teichm¨ uller deformation consists of dilating one of the two underlying
real analytic dimensions, while keeping the other dimension fixed. Moreover,
the theory of such Teichm¨ uller deformations may be summarized as consisting of
the explicit description of a varying holomorphic structure within a
fixed real analytic “container”
— i.e., the underlying real analytic surface associated to the given Riemann surface.
On the other hand, as discussed in [AbsTopIII], §I3, one may think of the ring
structure of a number field F as a single “arithmetic holomorphic dimen-
sion”, which, in fact, consists of two underlying “combinatorial dimensions”,
corresponding to
· its additive structure “ ” and its multiplicative structure “ ”.
When, for simplicity, the number field F is totally imaginary, one may think of
these two combinatorial dimensions as corresponding to the
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 23
· two cohomological dimensions of the absolute Galois group GF of F.
A similar statement holds in the case of the absolute Galois group Gk of a nonar-
chimedean local field k. In the case of complex archimedean fields k [i.e.,
topological fields isomorphic to the field of complex numbers equipped with its
usual topology], the two combinatorial dimensions of k may also be thought of as
corresponding to the
· two underlying topological/real dimensions of k.
Alternatively, in both the nonarchimedean and archimedean cases, one may think
of the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of k as corresponding to the
· group of units O×
k and value group k×/O×
k of k.
Indeed, in the nonarchimedean case, local class field theory implies that this last
point of view is consistent with the interpretation of the two underlying combi-
natorial dimensions via cohomological dimension; in the archimedean case, the
consistency of this last point of view with the interpretation of the two underly-
ing combinatorial dimensions via topological/real dimension is immediate from the
definitions.
This last interpretation in terms of groups of units and value groups is of
particular relevance in the context of the theory of the present series of papers.
That is to say, one may think of the Θ-link
†Ftht
∼
→ ‡Fmod
{†Θ
v

v

— which, as discussed in §I1, induces a full poly-isomorphism
†F⊢×
mod
∼
→ ‡F⊢×
mod
{O×
Fv
∼ → O×
Fv
— as a sort of “Teichm¨ uller deformation relative to a Θ-dilation”, i.e., a de-
formation of the ring structure of the number field equipped with an elliptic
curve constituted by the given initial Θ-data in which one dilates the underlying
combinatorial dimension corresponding to the local value groups relative to a “Θ-
factor”, whileoneleavesfixed, uptoisomorphism, theunderlyingcombinatorialdi-
mension corresponding to the local groups of units [cf. Remark 3.9.3]. This point
of view is reminiscent of the discussion in §I1 of “disentangling/dismantling”
of various structures associated to a number field.
In [IUTchIII], we shall consider two-dimensional diagrams of Θ±ellNF-Hodge
theaters which we shall refer to as log-theta-lattices. The two dimensions of such
diagrams correspond precisely to the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of
a ring. Of these two dimensions, the “theta dimension” consists of the Frobenius-
picture associated to [more elaborate versions of] the Θ-link. Many of the impor-
tant properties that involve this “theta dimension” are consequences of the theory
of [FrdI], [FrdII], [EtTh]. On the other hand, the “log dimension” consists of iter-
ated copies of the log-link, i.e., diagrams of the sort that are studied in [AbsTopIII].
}v∈Vbad
24 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
That is to say, whereas the “theta dimension” corresponds to “deformations of the
arithmetic holomorphic structure” of the given number field equipped with an el-
liptic curve, this “log dimension” corresponds to “rotations of the two underlying
combinatorial dimensions” of a ring that leave the arithmetic holomorphic struc-
ture fixed — cf. the discussion of the “juggling of , induced by log” in
[AbsTopIII], §I3. The ultimate conclusion of the theory of [IUTchIII] is that
the “a priori unbounded deformations” of the arithmetic holomorphic
structure given by the Θ-link in fact admit canonical bounds, which
may be thought of as a sort of reflection of the “hyperbolicity” of the
given number field equipped with an elliptic curve
— cf. [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12. Such canonical bounds may be thought of as
analogues for a number field of canonical bounds that arise from diﬀerentiating
Frobenius liftings in the context of p-adic hyperbolic curves — cf. the discus-
sion in the final portion of [AbsTopIII], §I5. Moreover, such canonical bounds are
obtained in [IUTchIII] as a consequence of
the explicit description of a varying arithmetic holomorphic struc-
ture within a fixed mono-analytic “container”
— cf. the discussion of §I2! — furnished by [IUTchIII], Theorem 3.11 [cf. also
the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remarks 3.12.2, 3.12.3, 3.12.4], i.e., a situation that
is entirely formally analogous to the summary of complex Teichm¨ uller theory given
above.
The significance of the log-theta-lattice is best understood in the context of
the analogy between the inter-universal Teichm¨ uller theory developed in the
present series of papers and the p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich].
Here, we recall for the convenience of the reader that the p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory
of [pOrd], [pTeich] may be summarized, [very!] roughly speaking, as a sort of
generalization, to the case of “quite general” p-adic hyperbolic curves, of
the classical p-adic theory surrounding the canonical representation
π1( (P1 \{0,1,∞})Qp ) → π1( (Mell)Qp ) → PGL2(Zp)
— where the “π1(−)’s” denote the´ etale fundamental group, relative to a suitable
basepoint; (Mell)Qp
denotes the moduli stack of elliptic curves over Qp; the first
arrow denotes the morphism induced by the elliptic curve over the projective line
minus three points determined by the classical Legendre form of the Weierstrass
equation; the second arrow is the representation determined by the p-power torsion
points of the tautological elliptic curve over (Mell)Qp. In particular, the reader who
is familiar with the theory of the classical representation of the above display, but
notwiththetheoryof[pOrd], [pTeich], mayneverthelessappreciate, toasubstantial
degree, theanalogybetweentheinter-universal Teichm¨ uller theorydevelopedinthe
present series of papers and the p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich] by
thinking in terms of the
well-known classical properties of this classical representation.
In some sense, the gap between the “quite general” p-adic hyperbolic curves that
appear in p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory and the classical case of (P1 \{0,1,∞})Qp may
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 25
be thought of, roughly speaking, as corresponding, relative to the analogy with the
theoryofthepresentseriesofpapers, tothegapbetweenarbitrary number fields
and the rational number field Q. This point of view is especially interesting in
the context of the discussion of §I5 below.
The analogy between the inter-universal Teichm¨ uller theory developed in
thepresentseriesofpapersandthep-adic Teichm¨ uller theoryof[pOrd], [pTeich]
is described to a substantial degree in the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I5, i.e., where
the “future Teichm¨ uller-like extension of the mono-anabelian theory” may be un-
derstood as referring precisely to the inter-universal Teichm¨ uller theory developed
in the present series of papers. The starting point of this analogy is the correspon-
dence between a number field equipped with a [once-punctured] elliptic curve [in the
present series of papers] and a hyperbolic curve over a positive characteristic perfect
field equipped with a nilpotent ordinary indigenous bundle [in p-adic Teichm¨ uller
theory] — cf. Fig. I4.1 below. That is to say, in this analogy, the number field—
which may be regarded as being equipped with a finite collection of “exceptional”
valuations, namely, in the notation of §I1, the valuations lying over Vbad
mod — corre-
sponds to the hyperbolic curve over a positive characteristic perfect field — which
may be thought of as a one-dimensional function field over a positive characteristic
perfect field, equipped with a finite collection of “exceptional” valuations, namely,
the valuations corresponding to the cusps of the curve.
On the other hand, the [once-punctured] elliptic curve in the present series
of papers corresponds to the nilpotent ordinary indigenous bundle in p-adic Te-
ichm¨ uller theory. Here, we recall that an indigenous bundle may be thought of as a
sort of “virtual analogue” of the first cohomology group of the tautological elliptic
curve over the moduli stack of elliptic curves. Indeed, the canonical indigenous
bundle over the moduli stack of elliptic curves arises precisely as the first de Rham
cohomology module of this tautological elliptic curve. Put another way, from the
point of view of fundamental groups, an indigenous bundle may be thought of as
a sort of “virtual analogue” of the abelianized fundamental group of the tau-
tological elliptic curve over the moduli stack of elliptic curves. By contrast, in the
present series of papers, it is of crucial importance to use the entire nonabelian
profinite ´ etale fundamental group — i.e., not just its abelizanization! — of the
given once-punctured elliptic curve over a number field. Indeed, only by working
with the entire profinite´ etale fundamental group can one avail oneself of the crucial
absolute anabelian theory developed in [EtTh], [AbsTopIII] [cf. the discussion
of §I3]. This state of aﬀairs prompts the following question:
To what extent can one extend the indigenous bundles that appear in clas-
sical complex and p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory to objects that serve as “vir-
tual analogues” of the entire nonabelian fundamental group of the
tautological once-punctured elliptic curve over the moduli stack of [once-
punctured] elliptic curves?
Although this question lies beyond the scope of the present series of papers, it is
26 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
the hope of the author that this question may be addressed in a future paper.

Now let us return to our discussion of the log-theta-lattice, which, as discussed
above, consists of two types of arrows, namely, Θ-link arrows and log-link ar-
rows. As discussed in [IUTchIII], Remark 1.4.1, (iii) — cf. also Fig. I4.1 above,
as well as Remark 3.9.3, (i), of the present paper — the Θ-link arrows correspond
to the “transition from pnZ/pn+1Z to pn−1Z/pnZ”, i.e., the mixed characteris-
tic extension structure of a ring of Witt vectors, while the log-link arrows, i.e.,
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 27
the portion of theory that is developed in detail in [AbsTopIII], and which will be
incorporated into the theory of the present series of papers in [IUTchIII], corre-
spond to the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic. As we shall see in
[IUTchIII], these two types of arrows fail to commute [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 1.4.1,
(i)]. This noncommutativity, or “intertwining”, of the Θ-link and log-link arrows
of the log-theta-lattice may be thought of as the analogue, in the context of the
theory of the present series of papers, of the well-known “intertwining between the
mixed characteristic extension structure of a ring of Witt vectors and the Frobenius
morphism in positive characteristic” that appears in the classical p-adic theory. In
particular, taken as a whole, the log-theta-lattice in the theory of the present series
of papers may be thought of as an analogue, for number fields equipped with a
[once-punctured] elliptic curve, of the canonical lifting, equipped with a canon-
ical Frobenius action — hence also the canonical Frobenius lifting over the
ordinary locus of the curve — associated to a positive characteristic hyperbolic
curve equipped with a nilpotent ordinary indigenous bundle in p-adic Teichm¨ uller
theory [cf. Fig. I4.1 above; the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remarks 3.12.3, 3.12.4].
Finally, we observe that it is of particular interest in the context of the present
discussion that a theory is developed in [CanLift], §3, that yields an absolute
anabelian reconstruction for the canonical liftings of p-adic Teichm¨ uller the-
ory. That is to say, whereas the original construction of such canonical liftings
given in [pOrd], §3, is relatively straightforward, the anabelian reconstruction given
in [CanLift], §3, of, for instance, the canonical lifting modulo p2 of the logarith-
mic special fiber consists of a highly nontrivial anabelian argument. This state of
aﬀairs is strongly reminiscent of the stark contrast between the relatively straight-
forwardconstructionofthelog-theta-latticegiveninthepresentseriesofpapersand
the description of an “alien arithmetic holomorphic structure” given in [IUTchIII],
Theorem 3.11 [cf. the discussion in the earlier portion of the present §I4], which
is achieved by applying highly nontrivial results in absolute anabelian geometry—
cf. Fig. I4.1 above. In this context, we observe that the absolute anabelian theory
of [AbsTopIII], §1, which plays a central role in the theory surrounding [IUTchIII],
Theorem 3.11, corresponds, in the theory of [CanLift], §3, to the absolute anabelian
reconstruction of the logarithmic special fiber given in [AbsAnab], §2 [i.e., in essence,
thetheoryofabsoluteanabeliangeometryoverfinitefieldsdevelopedin[Tama1]; cf.
also [Cusp], §2]. Moreover, just as the absolute anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII], §1,
follows essentially by combining a version of “Uchida’s Lemma” [cf. [AbsTopIII],
Proposition 1.3] with the theory of Belyi cuspidalization — i.e.,
[AbsTopIII], §1 = Uchida Lem. + Belyi cuspidalization
— the absolute anabelian geometry over finite fields of [Tama1], [Cusp], follows
essentially by combining a version of “Uchida’s Lemma” with an application [to
the counting of rational points] of the Lefschetz trace formula for [powers of] the
Frobenius morphism on a curve over a finite field — i.e.,
[Tama1], [Cusp] = Uchida Lem. + Lefschetz trace formula for Frob.
— cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I5. That is to say, it is perhaps worthy of
note that in the analogy between the inter-universal Teichm¨ uller theory developed
in the present series of papers and the p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich],
[CanLift], the application of the theory of Belyi cuspidalization over number fields
28 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
and mixed characteristic local fields may be thought of as corresponding to the
Lefschetz trace formula for [powers of] the Frobenius morphism on a curve over a
finite field, i.e.,
Belyi cuspidalization ←→ Lefschetz trace formula for Frobenius
[Here, we note in passing that this correspondence may be related to the corre-
spondence discussed in [AbsTopIII], §I5, between Belyi cuspidalization and the
Verschiebung on positive characteristic indigenous bundles by considering the ge-
ometry of Hecke correspondences modulo p, i.e., in essence, graphs of the Frobenius
morphism in characteristic p!] It is the hope of the author that these analogies and
correspondences might serve to stimulate further developments in the theory.
§I5. Other Galois-theoretic Approaches to Diophantine Geometry
The notion of anabelian geometry dates back to a famous “letter to Falt-
ings” [cf. [Groth]], written by Grothendieck in response to Faltings’ work on the
Mordell Conjecture [cf. [Falt]]. Anabelian geometry was apparently originally con-
ceived by Grothendieck as a new approach to obtaining results in diophantine
geometry such as the Mordell Conjecture. At the time of writing, the author is
not aware of any expositions by Grothendieck that expose this approach in detail.
Nevertheless, it appears that the thrust of this approach revolves around applying
the Section Conjecture for hyperbolic curves over number fields to obtain a con-
tradiction by applying this Section Conjecture to the “limit section” of the Galois
sections associated to any infinite sequence of rational points of a proper hyperbolic
curve over a number field [cf. [MNT], §4.1(B), for more details]. On the other hand,
to the knowledge of the author, at least at the time of writing, it does not appear
that any rigorous argument has been obtained either by Grothendieck or by other
mathematicians for deriving a new proof of the Mordell Conjecture from the [as
yet unproven] Section Conjecture for hyperbolic curves over number fields. Nev-
ertheless, one result that has been obtained is a new proof by M. Kim [cf. [Kim]]
of Siegel’s theorem concerning Q-rational points of the projective line minus three
points — a proof which proceeds by obtaining certain bounds on the cardinality
of the set of Galois sections, without applying the Section Conjecture or any other
results from anabelian geometry.
In light of the historical background just discussed, the theory exposed in
the present series of papers — which yields, in particular, a method for applying
results in absolute anabelian geometry to obtain diophantine results such
as those given in [IUTchIV] — occupies a somewhat curious position, relative to
the historical development of the mathematical ideas involved. That is to say, at a
purely formal level, the implication
anabelian geometry=⇒ diophantine results
at first glance looks something like a “confirmation” of Grothendieck’s original
intuition. On the other hand, closer inspection reveals that the approach of the
theory of the present series of papers — that is to say, the precise content of the
relationship between anabelian geometry and diophantine geometry established in
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 29
the present series of papers — diﬀers quite fundamentally from the sort of approach
that was apparently envisioned by Grothendieck.
Perhaps the most characteristic aspect of this diﬀerence lies in the central role
played by anabelian geometry over p-adic fields in the present series of papers.
That is to say, unlike the case with number fields, one central feature of anabelian
geometry over p-adic fields is the fundamental gap between relative and absolute
results [cf., e.g., [AbsTopI], Introduction]. This fundamental gap is closely related
to the notion of an “arithmetic Teichm¨ uller theory for number fields” [cf.
the discussion of §I4 of the present paper; [AbsTopIII], §I3, §I5] — i.e., a theory of
deformations not for the “arithmetic holomorphic structure” of a hyperbolic curve
over a number field, but rather for the “arithmetic holomorphic structure” of the
number field itself! Totheknowledgeoftheauthor, theredoesnotexistanymention
of such ideas [i.e., relative vs. absolute p-adic anabelian geometry; the notion of an
arithmetic Teichm¨ uller theory for number fields] in the works of Grothendieck.
As discussed in §I4, one fundamental theme of the theory of the present series
of papers is the issue of the
explicit description of the relationship between the additive structure and
the multiplicative structure of a ring/number field/local field.
Relative to the above discussion of the relationship between anabelian geometry
and diophantine geometry, it is of interest to note that this issue of understand-
ing/describing the relationship between addition and multiplication is, on the one
hand, a central theme in the proofs of various results in anabelian geometry [cf.,
e.g., [Tama1], [pGC], [AbsTopIII]] and, on the other hand, a central aspect of the
diophantine results obtained in [IUTchIV].
Fromahistoricalpointofview, itisalsoofinteresttonotethatresultsfromab-
solute anabelian geometry are applied in the present series of papers in the context
of the canonical splittings of the Frobenius-picture that arise by considering the
´ etale-picture [cf. the discussion in §I1 preceding Theorem A]. This state of aﬀairs
is reminiscent — relative to the point of view that the Grothendieck Conjecture
constitutes a sort of “anabelian version” of the Tate Conjecture for abelian varieties
[cf. the discussion of [MNT], §1.2] — of the role played by the Tate Conjecture for
abelian varieties in obtaining the diophantine results of [Falt], namely, by means
of the various semi-simplicity properties of the Tate module that arise as formal
consequences of the Tate Conjecture. That is to say, such semi-simplicity proper-
ties may also be thought of as “canonical splittings” that arise from Galois-theoretic
considerations [cf. the discussion of “canonical splittings” in the final portion of
[CombCusp], Introduction].
Certain aspects of the relationship between the inter-universal Teichm¨ uller
theory of the present series of papers and other Galois-theoretic approaches to dio-
phantine geometry are best understood in the context of the analogy, discussed in
§I4, between inter-universal Teichm¨ uller theory and p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory.
One way to think of the starting point of p-adic Teichm¨ uller is as an attempt to
construct a p-adic analogue of the theory of the action of SL2(Z) on the upper
half-plane, i.e., of the natural embedding
ρR : SL2(Z) → SL2(R)
30 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
of SL2(Z) as a discrete subgroup. This leads naturally to consideration of the
representation
ρZ
=
p
ρZp
: SL2(Z)∧ → SL2(Z) =
SL2(Zp)
p∈Primes
— where we write SL2(Z)∧ for the profinite completion of SL2(Z). If one thinks
of SL2(Z)∧ as the geometric ´ etale fundamental group of the moduli stack of elliptic
curves over a field of characteristic zero, then the p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory of
[pOrd], [pTeich] does indeed constitute a generalization of ρZp to more general p-
adic hyperbolic curves.
From a representation-theoretic point of view, the next natural direction
in which to further develop the theory of [pOrd], [pTeich] consists of attempting to
generalize the theory of representations into SL2(Zp) obtained in [pOrd], [pTeich]
to a theory concerning representations into SLn(Zp) for arbitrary n ≥2. This is
precisely the motivation that lies, for instance, behind the work of Joshi and Pauly
[cf. [JP]].
On the other hand, unlike the original motivating representation ρR, the rep-
resentation ρZ is far from injective, i.e., put another way, the so-called Congruence
Subgroup Property fails to hold in the case of SL2. This failure of injectivity means
that working with
ρZ only allows one to access a relatively limited portion of SL2(Z)∧
.
From this point of view, a more natural direction in which to further develop the
theory of [pOrd], [pTeich] is to consider the “anabelian version”
ρΔ : SL2(Z)∧ → Out(Δ1,1)
of ρZ — i.e., the natural outer representation on the geometric ´ etale fundamen-
tal group Δ1,1 of the tautological family of once-punctured elliptic curves over the
moduli stack of elliptic curves over a field of characteristic zero. Indeed, unlike the
case with ρZ, one knows [cf. [Asada]] that ρΔ is injective. Thus, the “arithmetic
Teichm¨ uller theory for number fields equipped with a [once-punctured] el-
liptic curve” constituted by the inter-universal Teichm¨ uller theory developed in
the present series of papers may [cf. the discussion of §I4!] be regarded as a
realization of this sort of “anabelian” approach to further developing the p-adic
Teichm¨ uller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich].
In the context of these two distinct possible directions for the further develop-
ment of the p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich], it is of interest to recall
the following elementary fact:
If G is a free pro-p group of rank ≥2, then a [continuous] representation
ρG : G → GLn(Qp)
can never be injective!
Indeed, assume that ρG is injective and write... ⊆Hj ⊆... ⊆Im(ρG) ⊆GLn(Qp)

j ⊗Qp) of the tensor product with Qp of the abelianization
of Hj may be computed at the level of Lie algebras, hence is bounded by the Qp-
dimension of the p-adic Lie group GLn(Qp), i.e., we have dim(Hab
j ⊗Qp) ≤n2, in
contradiction to the well-known fact since G∼
= Im(ρG) is free pro-p of rank ≥2, it
holds that dim(Hab
j ⊗Qp) →∞as j →∞. Note, moreover, that
this sort of argument, i.e., concerning the asymptotic behavior of the
abelianizations — or, more generally, of the Lie algebras associated to
the pro-algebraic groups determined by associated Tannakian categories
of representations — of open subgroups, is characteristic of the sort of
proofs that typically occur in anabelian geometry [cf., e.g., the proofs
of [Tama1], [pGC], [CombGC], as well as [Cusp], §3!].
That is to say, the above argument to the eﬀect that ρG can never be injective is a
typical instance of the more general phenomenon that
so long as one restricts oneself to representation theory into GLn(Qp)
[or even more general groups that arise as groups of Qp-valued points
of pro-algebraic groups], one can never access the sort of asymptotic
phenomena that form the “technical core” [cf., e.g., the proofs of
[Tama1], [pGC], [CombGC], as well as [Cusp], §3!] of various important
results in anabelian geometry.
Put another way, the two “directions” discussed above — i.e., representation-
theoretic and anabelian — appear to be essentially mutually alien to one
another.
In this context, it is of interest to observe that the diophantine results de-
rived in [IUTchIV] from the inter-universal Teichm¨ uller theory developed in the
present series of papers concern essentially asymptotic behavior, i.e., they do
not concern properties of “a specific rational point over a specific number field”,
but rather properties of the asymptotic behavior of “varying rational points over
varying number fields”. One important aspect of this asymptotic nature of the dio-
phantine results derived in [IUTchIV] is that there are no distinguished number
fields that occur in the theory, i.e., the theory — being essentially asymptotic in
nature! — is “invariant” with respect to the operation of passing to finite exten-
sions of the number field involved [which, from the point of view of the absolute
Galois group GQ of Q, corresponds precisely to the operation of passing to smaller
and smaller open subgroups, as in the above discussion!]. This contrasts sharply
with the “representation-theoretic approach to diophantine geometry” constituted
by such works as [Wiles], where specific rational points over the specific number field
Q — or, for instance, in generalizations of [Wiles] involving Shimura varieties, over
specific number fields characteristically associated to the Shimura varieties involved
— play a central role.

Section 0: Notations and Conventions
Monoids and Categories:
We shall use the notation and terminology concerning monoids and categories
of [FrdI], §0.
We shall refer to a topological space P equipped with a continuous map
P ×P ⊇S → P
as a topological pseudo-monoid if there exists a topological abelian group M [whose
group operation will be written multiplicatively] and an embedding of topological
spaces ι : P →M such that S= {(a,b) ∈P ×P |ι(a)·ι(b) ∈ι(P) ⊆M}, and
the map S →P is obtained by restricting the group operation M ×M →M on
M to P by means of ι. Here, if M is equipped with the discrete topology, then
we shall refer to the resulting P simply as a pseudo-monoid. In particular, every
topologicalpseudo-monoiddetermines, inanevidentfashion, anunderlyingpseudo-
monoid. Let P be a pseudo-monoid. Then we shall say that the pseudo-monoid
P is divisible if M and ι may be taken such that for each positive integer n, every
element of M admits an n-th root in M, and, moreover, an element a ∈M lies
in ι(P) if and only if an lies in ι(P). We shall say that the pseudo-monoid P is
cyclotomic if M and ι may be taken such that the subgroup μM ⊆M of torsion
elements of M is isomorphic to the group Q/Z, μM ⊆ι(P), and μM·ι(P) ⊆ι(P).
We shall refer to an isomorphic copy of some object as an isomorph of the
object.
If Cand Dare categories, then we shall refer to as an isomorphism C→Dany
isomorphism class of equivalences of categories C→D. [Note that this terminology
diﬀers from the standard terminology of category theory, but will be natural in the
context of the theory of the present series of papers.] Thus, from the point of view
of “coarsifications of 2-categories of 1-categories” [cf. [FrdI], Appendix, Definition
A.1, (ii)], an “isomorphism C→D” is precisely an “isomorphism in the usual sense”
of the [1-]category constituted by the coarsification of the 2-category of all small
1-categories relative to a suitable universe with respect to which Cand Dare small.
Let Cbe a category; A,B ∈Ob(C). Then we define a poly-morphism A →B
to be a collection of morphisms A →B [i.e., a subset of the set of morphisms
A →B]; if all of the morphisms in the collection are isomorphisms, then we shall
refer to the poly-morphism as a poly-isomorphism; if A= B, then we shall re-
fer to a poly-isomorphism A∼
→B as a poly-automorphism. We define the full
poly-isomorphism A∼
→B to be the poly-morphism given by the collection of all
isomorphisms A∼
→B. The composite of a poly-morphism {fi : A →B}i∈I with a
poly-morphism {gj : B →C}j∈J is defined to be the poly-morphism given by the
set [i.e., where “multiplicities” are ignored] {gj ◦fi : A →C}(i,j)∈I×J.
Let Cbe a category. We define a capsule of objects of Cto be a finite collection
{Aj}j∈J [i.e., where J is a finite index set] of objects Aj of C; if |J|denotes the
34 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
cardinality of J, then we shall refer to a capsule with index set J as a |J|-capsule;
also, we shall write π0({Aj}j∈J) def
= J. A morphism of capsules of objects of C
{Aj}j∈J →{A′
j′}j′∈J′
is defined to consist of an injection ι : J →J′, together with, for each j ∈J, a
morphism Aj →A′
ι(j) of objects of C. Thus, the capsules of objects of Cform a
category Capsule(C). A capsule-full poly-morphism
{Aj}j∈J →{A′
j′}j′∈J′
between two objects of Capsule(C) is defined to be the poly-morphism associated
to some [fixed] injection ι : J →J′ which consists of the set of morphisms of
Capsule(C) given by collections of [arbitrary] isomorphisms Aj
∼
→A′
ι(j), for j ∈
J. A capsule-full poly-isomorphism is a capsule-full poly-morphism for which the
associated injection between index sets is a bijection.
If X is a connected noetherian algebraic stack which is generically scheme-like
[cf. [Cusp], §0], then we shall write
B(X)
for the category of finite ´ etale coverings of X [and morphisms over X]; if A is a
noetherian [commutative] ring [with unity],thenweshallwriteB(A) def
= B(Spec(A)).
Thus, [cf. [FrdI], §0] the subcategory of connected objects B(X)0 ⊆B(X) may
be thought of as the subcategory of connected finite ´ etale coverings of X [and
morphisms over X].
Let Π be a topological group. Then let us write
Btemp(Π)
for the category whose objects are countable [i.e., of cardinality ≤the cardinality
of the set of natural numbers], discrete sets equipped with a continuous Π-action,
and whose morphisms are morphisms of Π-sets [cf. [SemiAnbd], §3]. If Π may be
written as an inverse limit of an inverse system of surjections of countable discrete
topological groups, then we shall say that Π is tempered [cf. [SemiAnbd], Definition
3.1, (i)]. A category Cequivalent to a category of the form Btemp(Π), where Π is a
tempered topological group, is called a connected temperoid [cf. [SemiAnbd], Defi-
nition 3.1, (ii)]. Thus, if Cis a connected temperoid, then Cis naturally equivalent
to (C0)⊤ [cf. [FrdI], §0]. Moreover, if Π is Galois-countable [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i),
(T1)], then one can reconstruct [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T5)] the topological group Π,
up to inner automorphism, category-theoretically from Btemp(Π) or Btemp(Π)0 [i.e.,
the subcategory of connected objects of Btemp(Π)]; in particular, for any Galois-
countable [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T1)] connected temperoid C, it makes sense to
write
π1(C), π1(C0)
for the topological groups, up to inner automorphism, obtained by applying this
reconstruction algorithm [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T5)].

In this context, if C1, C2 are connected temperoids, then it is natural to define
a morphism
C1 →C2
to be an isomorphism class of functors C2 →C1 that preserves finite limits and
countablecolimits. [Notethatthisdiﬀers—butonlyslightly! —fromthedefinition
given in [SemiAnbd], Definition 3.1, (iii). This diﬀerence does not, however, have
any eﬀect on the applicability of results of [SemiAnbd] in the context of the present
series of papers.] In a similar vein, we define a morphism
C0
1 →C0
2
tobeamorphism(C0
1)⊤ →(C0
2)⊤ [wherewerecallthatwehavenaturalequivalences
∼
of categories Ci
→(C0
i )⊤ for i = 1,2]. One verifies immediately that an “isomor-
phism” relative to this terminology is equivalent to an “isomorphism of categories”
in the sense defined at the beginning of the present discussion of “Monoids and
Categories”. Finally, if Π1, Π2 are Galois-countable [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T1)]
tempered topological groups, then we recall that there is a natural bijective corre-
spondence between
(a) the set of continuous outer homomorphisms Π1 →Π2,
(b) the set of morphisms Btemp(Π1) →Btemp(Π2), and
(c) the set of morphisms Btemp(Π1)0 →Btemp(Π2)0
— cf. Remark 2.5.3, (ii), (E7); [SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.2.
Suppose that for i = 1,2, Ci and C′
i are categories. Then we shall say that two
isomorphism classes of functors φ : C1 →C2, φ′ : C′
1 →C′
2 are abstractly equivalent
if, for i = 1,2, there exist isomorphisms αi : Ci
∼ →C′
i such that φ′ ◦α1 = α2 ◦φ. We
shall also apply this terminology to morphisms between [connected] temperoids,
as well as to morphisms between subcategories of connected objects of [connected]
temperoids.
Numbers:
WeshallusetheabbreviationsNF(“numberfield”), MLF(“mixed-characteris-
tic [nonarchimedean] local field”), CAF (“complex archimedean field”), as defined
in [AbsTopI], §0; [AbsTopIII], §0. We shall denote the set of prime numbers by
Primes.
Let F be a number field [i.e., a finite extension of the field of rational numbers].
Then we shall write
V(F) = V(F)arc V(F)non
for the set of valuations of F, that is to say, the union of the sets of archimedean
[i.e., V(F)arc] and nonarchimedean [i.e., V(F)non] valuations of F. Here, we note
that this terminology “valuation”, as it is applied in the present series of papers,
corresponds to such terminology as “place” or “absolute value” in the work of other
authors. Let v ∈V(F). Then we shall write Fv for the completion of F at v and
say that an element of F or Fv is integral [at v] if it is of norm ≤1 with respect
to the valuation v; if, moreover, L is any [possibly infinite] Galois extension of F,
36 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
then, by a slight abuse of notation, we shall write Lv for the completion of L at
some valuation ∈V(L) that lies over v. If v ∈V(F)non, then we shall write pv
for the residue characteristic of v. If v ∈V(F)arc, then we shall write pv ∈Fv
for the unique positive real element of Fv whose natural logarithm is equal to 1
[i.e., “e = 2.71828...”]. By passing to appropriate projective or inductive limits,
we shall also apply the notation “V(F)”, “Fv”, “pv” in situations where “F” is an
infinite extension of Q.
Curves:
We shall use the terms hyperbolic curve, cusp, stable log curve, and smooth
log curve as they are defined in [SemiAnbd], §0. We shall use the term hyperbolic
orbicurve as it is defined in [Cusp], §0.

Section 1: Complements on Coverings of Punctured Elliptic Curves
In the present §1, we discuss certain routine complements — which will be of
use in the present series of papers — to the theory of coverings of once-punctured
elliptic curves, as developed in [EtTh], §2.
Let l ≥5 be an integer prime to 6; X a hyperbolic curve of type (1,1) over a
field k of characteric zero; C a hyperbolic orbicurve of type (1,l-tors)± [cf. [EtTh],
Definition 2.1] over k, whose k-core C [cf. [CanLift], Remark 2.1.1; [EtTh], the
discussion at the beginning of §2] also forms a k-core of X. Thus, C determines,
up to k-isomorphism, a hyperbolic orbicurve X def
= C ×C X of type (1,l-tors) [cf.
[EtTh], Definition 2.1] over k. Moreover, if we write Gk for the absolute Galois
group of k [relative to an appropriate choice of basepoint], Π(−) for the arithmetic
fundamental group of a geometrically connected, geometrically normal, generically
scheme-like k-algebraic stack of finite type “(−)” [i.e., the ´ etale fundamental group
π1((−))], and Δ(−) for the geometric fundamental group of “(−)” [i.e., the kernel
of the natural surjection Π(−) Gk], then we obtain natural cartesian diagrams

of finite ´ etale coverings of hyperbolic orbicurves and open immersions of profinite
groups. Finally, let us make the following assumption:
(∗) The natural action of Gk on Δab
X ⊗(Z/lZ) [where the superscript “ab”
denotes the abelianization] is trivial.
Next, let ϵ be a nonzero cusp of C — i.e., a cusp that arises from a nonzero
elementofthequotient“Q”thatappearsinthedefinitionofa“hyperbolicorbicurve
of type (1,l-tors)±” given in [EtTh], Definition 2.1. Write ϵ0 for the unique “zero
cusp” [i.e., “non-nonzero cusp”] of X; ϵ′
, ϵ′′ for the two cusps of X that lie over ϵ;
and
ΔX Δab
X ⊗(Z/lZ) Δϵ
for the quotient of Δab
X ⊗(Z/lZ) by the images of the inertia groups of all nonzero
cusps ̸= ϵ′,ϵ′′ of X. Thus, we obtain a natural exact sequence
0 −→ Iϵ′ ×Iϵ′′ −→ Δϵ −→ ΔE ⊗(Z/lZ) −→ 0
— where we write E for the genus one compactification of X, and Iϵ′, Iϵ′′ for
the respective images in Δϵ of the inertia groups of the cusps ϵ′
, ϵ′′ [so we have
noncanonical isomorphisms Iϵ′
∼
= Z/lZ∼
= Iϵ′′].
Next, let us observe that Gk, Gal(X/C) (∼
= Z/2Z) act naturally on the above
exact sequence. Write ι ∈Gal(X/C) for the unique nontrivial element. Then ι
induces an isomorphism Iϵ′
∼
= Iϵ′′; if we use this isomorphism to identify Iϵ′, Iϵ′′,
then one verifies immediately that ι acts on the term “Iϵ′ ×Iϵ′′” of the above exact
sequence by switching the two factors. Moreover, one verifies immediately that ι
38 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
acts on ΔE⊗(Z/lZ) via multiplication by−1. In particular, since l is odd, it follows
that the action by ι on Δϵ determines a decomposition into eigenspaces
Δϵ
∼
→Δ+
ϵ ×Δ−
ϵ
— i.e., where ι acts on Δ+
ϵ (respectively, Δ−
ϵ ) by multiplication by +1 (respectively,
−1). Moreover, the natural composite maps
Iϵ′ →Δϵ Δ+
ϵ ; Iϵ′′ →Δϵ Δ+
ϵ
∼
determine isomorphisms Iϵ′
→Δ+
∼
ϵ , Iϵ′′
→Δ+
ϵ . Since the natural action of Gk
on Δϵ clearly commutes with the action of ι, we thus conclude that the quotient
ΔX Δϵ Δ+
ϵ determines quotients
ΠX JX; ΠC JC
— where the surjections ΠX Gk, ΠC Gk induce natural exact sequences
1 →Δ+
ϵ →JX →Gk →1, 1 →Δ+
ϵ ×Gal(X/C) →JC →Gk →1; we have a
natural inclusion JX →JC.
Next, letusconsiderthecusp“2ϵ”ofC —i.e., thecuspwhoseinverseimagesin
X correspond to the points of E obtained by multiplying ϵ′
, ϵ′′ by 2, relative to the
grouplawoftheellipticcurvedeterminedbythepair(X,ϵ0). Since2 ̸= ±1 (mod l)
[aconsequenceofourassumptionthatl ≥5], itfollowsthatthedecomposition group
associated to this cusp “2ϵ” determines a section
σ : Gk →JC
of the natural surjection JC Gk. Here, we note that although, a priori, σ is only
determined by 2ϵ up to composition with an inner automorphism of JC determined
by an element of Δ+
ϵ ×Gal(X/C), in fact, since [in light of the assumption (∗)!]
the natural [outer] action of Gk on Δ+
ϵ ×Gal(X/C) is trivial, we conclude that σ
is completely determined by 2ϵ, and that the subgroup Im(σ) ⊆JC determined by
the image of σ is normal in JC. Moreover, by considering the decomposition groups
associated to the cusps of X lying over 2ϵ, we conclude that Im(σ) lies inside the
subgroup JX ⊆JC. Thus, the subgroups Im(σ) ⊆JX, Im(σ) ×Gal(X/C) ⊆JC
determine [the horizontal arrows in] cartesian diagrams

Remark 1.1.2. We observe that X
− →, C
− →are completely determined, up to k-
isomorphism, by the data (X/k, C, ϵ).
Corollary 1.2. (Characteristic Nature of Coverings) Suppose that k is
an NF or an MLF. Then there exists a functorial group-theoretic algorithm
[cf. [AbsTopIII], Remark 1.9.8, for more on the meaning of this terminology] to
reconstruct
ΠX, ΠC
− →, ΠC (respectively, ΠC)
together with the conjugacy classes of the decomposition group(s) determined by the
set(s) of cusps {ϵ′,ϵ′′}; {ϵ}(respectively, {ϵ}) from ΠX
− → (respectively, ΠC
− →). Here,
the asserted functoriality is with respect to isomorphisms of topological groups; we
reconstruct ΠX, ΠC
− →, ΠC (respectively, ΠC) as a subgroup of Aut(ΠX
− →) (respectively,
Aut(ΠC
− →)).
Proof. For simplicity, we consider the non-resp’d case; the resp’d case is entirely
similar [but slightly easier]. The argument is similar to the arguments applied in
[EtTh], Proposition 1.8; [EtTh], Proposition 2.4. First, we recall that ΠX
− →, ΠX, and
ΠC are slim [cf., e.g., [AbsTopI], Proposition 2.3, (ii)], hence embed naturally into
Aut(ΠX
− →), and that one may recover the subgroup ΔX
− → ⊆ΠX
− → via the algorithms of
[AbsTopI],Theorem2.6, (v), (vi). Next, werecallthatthealgorithmsof[AbsTopII],
Corollary 3.3, (i), (ii) — which are applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example 4.8
— allow one to reconstruct ΠC [together with the natural inclusion ΠX

as well as the subgroups ΔX ⊆ΔC ⊆ΠC. In particular, l may be recovered via
the formula l2 = [ΔX : ΔX]·[ΔX : ΔX
− →] = [ΔX : ΔX
− →] = [ΔC : ΔX
− →]/2. Next, let
us set H def = Ker(ΔX Δab
X ⊗(Z/lZ)). Then ΠX ⊆ΠC may be recovered via the
[easily verified] equality of subgroups ΠX = ΠX
− →·H. The conjugacy classes of the
decomposition groups of ϵ0
, ϵ′
, ϵ′′ in ΠX may be recovered as the decomposition
groups of cusps [cf. [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, as well as Remark 1.2.2, (ii), below]
whoseimageinGal(X
− →/X) = ΠX/ΠX
isnontrivial. Next, toreconstructΠC ⊆ΠC,
− →
it suﬃces to reconstruct the splitting of the surjection Gal(X/C) = ΠC/ΠX
ΠC/ΠX = Gal(X/C) determined by Gal(X/C) = ΠC/ΠX; but [since l is prime to
3!] this splitting may be characterized [group-theoretically!] as the unique splitting
that stabilizes the collection of conjugacy classes of subgroups of ΠX determined
by the decomposition groups of ϵ0
, ϵ′
, ϵ′′. Now ΠC
− → ⊆ΠC may be reconstructed
by applying the observation that (Z/2Z∼
=) Gal(X
− →/C− →) ⊆Gal(X
− →/C) (∼
= Z/2lZ)
is the unique maximal subgroup of odd index. Finally, the conjugacy classes of
the decomposition groups of ϵ′
, ϵ′′ in ΠX may be recovered as the decomposition
groups of cusps [cf. [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, as well as Remark 1.2.2, (ii), below]
whose image in Gal(X

− →
is nontrivial, but which are not fixed [up to
40 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
conjugacy] by the outer action of Gal(X/C) = ΠC/ΠX on ΠX. This completes the
proof of Corollary 1.2. ⃝
Remark 1.2.1. It follows immediately from Corollary 1.2 that
Autk(X
− →) = Gal(X
− →/C) (∼
= Z/2lZ); Autk(C
− →) = Gal(C
− →/C) (∼
= Z/lZ)
[cf. [EtTh], Remark 2.6.1].
Remark 1.2.2. The group-theoretic algorithm for reconstructing the decomposi-
tion groups of cusps given [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5 — which is based on the argument
given in the proof of [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.3.9 — contains some minor, inessential
inaccuracies. In light of the importance of this group-theoretic algorithm for the
theory of the present series of papers, we thus pause to discuss how these inaccu-
racies may be amended.
(i) The final portion [beginning with the third sentence] of the second paragraph
of the proof of [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.3.9, should be replaced by the following text:
Since ri may be recovered group-theoretically, given any finite ´ etale cov-
erings
Zi →Vi →Xi
such that Zi is cyclic [hence Galois], of degree a power of l, over Vi,
one may determine group-theoretically whether or not Zi →Vi is totally
ramified [i.e., at some point of Zi], since this condition is easily verified
to be equivalent to the condition that the covering Zi → Vi admit a
factorization Zi →Wi →Vi, where Wi →Vi is finite ´ etale of degree l,
and rWi < l·rVi. Moreover, this group-theoreticity of the condition that a
cyclic covering be totally ramified extends immediately to the case of pro-l
cyclic coverings Zi →Vi. Thus, by Lemma 1.3.7, we conclude that the
inertia groups of cusps in(ΔXi)(l) [i.e., themaximalpro-l quotientofΔXi]
may be characterized [group-theoretically!] as the maximal subgroups of
(ΔXi)(l) that correspond to [profinite] coverings satisfying this condition.
(ii) The final portion [beginning with the third sentence] of the statement of
[AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, (iv), should be replaced by the following text:
Then the decomposition groups of cusps ⊆ H∗ may be character-
ized [“group-theoretically”] as the maximal closed subgroups I ⊆H∗
isomorphic to Zl which satisfy the following condition: We have
d

G ((Il

[i.e., “the covering of curves corresponding to J ⊆I·J is totally ramified
at some cusp”] for every characteristic open subgroup J ⊆H∗ such that
J ̸= I·J.
Remark 1.2.3. The minor, inessential inaccuracies in the group-theoretic al-
gorithms of [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.3.9; [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, that were discussed
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 41
in Remark 1.2.2 are closely related to certain minor, inessential inaccuracies in
the theory of [CombGC]. Thus, it is of interest, in the context of the discussion of
Remark 1.2.2, to pause to discuss how these inaccuracies may be amended. These
inaccuracies arise in the arguments applied in [CombGC], Definition 1.4, (v), (vi),
and [CombGC], Remarks 1.4.2, 1.4.3, and 1.4.4, to prove [CombGC], Theorem
1.6. These arguments are formulated in a somewhat confusing way and should be
modified as follows:
(i) First of all, we remark that in [CombGC], as well as in the following dis-
cussion, a “Galois” finite ´ etale covering is to be understood as being connected.
(ii) In the second sentence of [CombGC], Definition 1.4, (v), the cuspidal and
nodal cases of the notion of a purely totally ramified covering are in fact unnecessary
and may be deleted. Also, the terminology introduced in [CombGC], Definition
1.4, (vi), concerning finite ´ etale coverings that descend is unnecessary and may be
deleted.
(iii) The text of [CombGC], Remark 1.4.2, should be replaced by the following
text:
Let G′ →Gbe a Galois finite ´ etale covering of degree a positive power of
l, where Gis of pro-Σ PSC-type, Σ = {l}. Then one verifies immediately
that, if we assume further that the covering G′ →Gis cyclic, then G′ →G
is cuspidally totally ramified if and only if the inequality
r(G′′) < l·r(G)
— where we write G′ → G′′ → G for the unique [up to isomorphism]
factorization of the finite ´ etale covering G′ →Gas a composite of finite
´ etale coverings such that G′′ →Gis of degree l — is satisfied. Suppose
further that G′ →Gis a [not necessarily cyclic!] Πunr
G -covering [so n(G′) =
deg(G′/G)·n(G)]. Then one verifies immediately that G′ →Gis verticially
purely totally ramified if and only if the equality
i(G′) = deg(G′/G)·(i(G)−1)+1
is satisfied. Also, we observe that this last inequality is equivalent to the
following equality involving the expression “i(...)−n(...)” [cf. Remark
1.1.3]:
i(G′)−n(G′) = deg(G′/G)·(i(G)−n(G)−1)+1
(iv) The text of [CombGC], Remark 1.4.3, should be replaced by the following
text:
Suppose that Gis of pro-Σ PSC-type, Σ = {l}. Then one verifies immedi-
ately that the cuspidal edge-like subgroups of ΠG may be characterized as
the maximal [cf. Proposition 1.2, (i)] closed subgroups A ⊆ΠG isomorphic
to Zl which satisfy the following condition:
for every characteristic open subgroup ΠG′ ⊆ΠG, if we write
G′ → G′′ → G for the finite ´ etale coverings corresponding to
42 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
def
ΠG′ ⊆ΠG′′
= A·ΠG′ ⊆ΠG, then the cyclic finite ´ etale covering
G′ →G′′ is cuspidally totally ramified.
[Indeed, the necessity of this characterization is immediate from the def-
initions; the suﬃciency of this characterization follows by observing that
since the set of cusps of a finite ´ etale covering of Gis always finite, the
above condition implies that there exists a compatible system of cusps of
the various G′ that arise, each of which is stabilized by the action of A.] On
the other hand, in order to characterize the unramified verticial subgroups
of Πunr
G , it suﬃces — by considering stabilizers of vertices of underlying
semi-graphs of finite ´ etale Πunr
G -coverings of G— to give a functorial char-
acterization of the set of vertices of G [i.e., which may also be applied
to finite ´ etale Πunr
G -coverings of G]. This may be done, for sturdy G, as
follows. Write Munr
G for the abelianization of Πunr
G . For each vertex v of
the underlying semi-graph G of G, write Munr
G [v] ⊆Munr
G for the image of
the Πunr
G -conjugacy class of unramified verticial subgroups of Πunr
G associ-
ated to v. Then one verifies immediately, by constructing suitable abelian
Πunr
G -coverings of Gvia suitable gluing operations [i.e., as in the proof of
Proposition 1.2], that the inclusions Munr
G [v] ⊆Munr
G determine a split
injection
Munr
G [v] → Munr
G
v
[wherev rangesovertheverticesofG],whoseimagewedenotebyMunr-vert
G ⊆
Munr
G . Now we consider elementary abelian quotients
φ : Munr
G Q
— i.e., where Q is an elementary abelian group. We identify such quotients
whenever their kernels coincide and order such quotients by means of the
relation of “domination” [i.e., inclusion of kernels]. Then one verifies im-
mediately that such a quotient φ : Munr
G Q corresponds to a verticially
purely totally ramified covering of Gif and only if there exists a vertex v
of G such that φ(Munr
G [v]) = Q, φ(Munr
G [v′]) = 0 for all vertices v′ ̸= v of
G. In particular, one concludes immediately that
the elementary abelian quotients φ : Munr
G Q whose restric-
tion to Munr-vert
G surjects onto Q and has the same kernel as the
quotient
Munr-vert
G Munr
G [v] Munr
G [v]⊗Fl
— where the first “ ” is the natural projection; the second “ ”
is given by reduction modulo l — may be characterized as the
maximal quotients [i.e., relative to the relation of domination]
among those elementary abelian quotients of Munr
G that corre-
spond to verticially purely totally ramified coverings of G.
Thus, since Gis sturdy, the set of vertices of Gmay be characterized as
the set of [nontrivial!] quotients Munr-vert
G Munr
G [v]⊗Fl.

(v) The text of [CombGC], Remark 1.4.4, should be replaced by the following
text:
Suppose that G is of pro-Σ PSC-type, where Σ = {l}, and that G is
noncuspidal. Then, in the spirit of the cuspidal portion of Remark 1.4.3,
we observe the following: One verifies immediately that the nodal edge-like
subgroups of ΠG may be characterized as the maximal [cf. Proposition 1.2,
(i)] closed subgroups A ⊆ΠG isomorphic to Zl which satisfy the following
condition:
for every characteristic open subgroup ΠG′ ⊆ΠG, if we write
G′ → G′′ → G for the finite ´ etale coverings corresponding to
def
ΠG′ ⊆ΠG′′
= A·ΠG′ ⊆ΠG, then the cyclic finite ´ etale covering
G′ →G′′ is nodally totally ramified.
Here, we note further that [one verifies immediately that] the finite ´ etale
covering G′ →G′′ is nodally totally ramified if and only if it is module-wise
nodal.
(vi) The text of the second paragraph of the proof of [CombGC], Theorem 1.6,
should be replaced by the following text [which may be thought as being appended
to the end of the first paragraph of the proof of [CombGC], Theorem 1.6]:
Then the fact that α is group-theoretically cuspidal follows formally from
the characterization of cuspidal edge-like subgroups given in Remark 1.4.3
and the characterization of cuspidally totally ramified cyclic finite ´ etale
coverings given in Remark 1.4.2.
(vii) The text of the final paragraph of the proof of [CombGC], Theorem 1.6,
should be replaced by the following text [which may be thought of as a sort of
“easy version” of the argument given in the proof of the implication “(iii) =⇒(i)”
of [CbTpII], Proposition 1.5]:
Finally, we consider assertion (iii). Suﬃciency is immediate. On the
other hand, necessity follows formally from the characterization of unram-
ified verticial subgroups given in Remark 1.4.3 and the characterization
of verticially purely totally ramified finite ´ etale coverings given in Remark
1.4.2.

Section 2: Complements on Tempered Coverings
In the present §2, we discuss certain routine complements — which will be of
use in the present series of papers — to the theory of tempered coverings of graphs
of anabelioids, as developed in [SemiAnbd], §3 [cf. also the closely related theory
of [CombGC]].
Let Σ, Σ be nonempty sets of prime numbers such that Σ ⊆Σ;
G
a semi-graph of anabelioids of pro-Σ PSC-type [cf. [CombGC], Definition 1.1, (i)],
whose underlying semi-graph we denote by G. Write Πtp
G for the tempered funda-
mental group of G[cf. the discussion preceding [SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.6, as
well as Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T6), of the present paper] and ΠG for the pro-Σ [i.e.,
maximal pro-Σ quotient of the profinite] fundamental group of G[cf. the discussion
preceding [SemiAnbd], Definition 2.2] — both taken with respect to appropriate
choices of basepoints. Thus, since discrete free groups of finite rank inject into
their pro-l completions for any prime number l [cf., e.g., [RZ], Proposition 3.3.15],
it follows that we have a natural injection [cf. [SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.6, (iii), as
well as Remark 2.5.3, (ii), (E7), of the present paper, when Σ = Primes; the proof
in the case of arbitrary Σ is entirely similar]
Πtp
G →ΠG
that we shall use to regard Πtp
G as a subgroup of ΠG and ΠG as the pro-Σ completion
of Πtp
G.
Next, let
H
be the semi-graph of anabelioids associated to a connected sub-semi-graph H ⊆
G. One verifies immediately that the restriction of Hto the maximal subgraph
[cf. the discussion at the beginning of [SemiAnbd], §1] of H coincides with the
restriction to the maximal subgraph of the underlying semi-graph of some semi-
graph of anabelioids of pro-Σ PSC-type. That is to say, roughly speaking, up to the
possible omission of some of the cuspidal edges, H“is” a semi-graph of anabelioids
of pro-Σ PSC-type. In particular, since the omission of cuspidal edges clearly does
not aﬀect either the tempered or pro-Σ fundamental groups, we shall apply the
notation introduced above for “G” to H. We thus obtain a natural commutative
diagram

H −→ ΠH

Πtp

of [outer] inclusions [cf. [SemiAnbd], Proposition 2.5, (i), when Σ = Primes; in
light of the well-known structure of fundamental groups of hyperbolic Riemann
surfaces of finite type, a similar proof may be given in the case of arbitrary Σ, i.e.,
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 45
by considering successive composites of finite ´ etale Galois coverings that restrict to
trivial coverings over the closed edges and finite ´ etale abelian [Galois] coverings ob-
tained by gluing together suitable abelian coverings] of topological groups, which we
shall use to regard all of the groups in the diagram as subgroups of ΠG. In partic-
ular, one may think of Πtp
H (respectively, ΠH) as the decomposition subgroup in Πtp
G
(respectively, ΠG) [which is well-defined up to Πtp
G - (respectively, ΠG-)conjugacy]
associated to the sub-semi-graph H.
The following result is the central technical result underlying the theory of the
present §2.
Proposition 2.1. (Profinite Conjugates of Nontrivial Compact Sub-
groups) In the notation of the above discussion, let Λ ⊆ Πtp
G be a nontrivial
compact subgroup, γ ∈ΠG an element such that γ·Λ·γ−1 ⊆Πtp
G [or, equiva-
lently, Λ ⊆γ−1
·Πtp
G·γ]. Then γ ∈Πtp
G.
Proof. Write Γ for the “pro-Σ semi-graph” associated to the universal pro-Σ´ etale
covering of G[i.e., the covering corresponding to the subgroup {1}⊆ΠG]; Γtp for
the “pro-semi-graph” associated to the universal tempered covering of G[i.e., the
covering corresponding to the subgroup {1}⊆Πtp
G ]. Thus, we have a natural dense
map Γtp →Γ. Let us refer to a [“pro-”]vertex of Γ that occurs as the image of
a [“pro-”]vertex of Γtp as tempered. Since Λ, γ·Λ·γ−1 are compact subgroups of
Πtp
G , it follows from [SemiAnbd], Theorem 3.7, (iii) [cf. also [SemiAnbd], Example
3.10, as well as Remark 2.5.3, (ii), (E7), of the present paper], that there exist
verticial subgroups Λ′
,Λ′′ ⊆Πtp
G such that Λ ⊆Λ′
, γ·Λ·γ−1 ⊆Λ′′. Thus, Λ′
,
Λ′′ correspond to tempered vertices v′
, v′′ of Γ; {1}̸= γ·Λ·γ−1 ⊆γ·Λ′
·γ−1, so
(γ·Λ′
·γ−1) Λ′′ ̸= {1}. Since Λ′′
, γ·Λ′
·γ−1 are both verticial subgroups of
ΠG, it thus follows either from [AbsTopII], Proposition 1.3, (iv), or from [NodNon],
Proposition 3.9, (i), that the corresponding vertices v′′, (v′)γ of Γ are either equal
or adjacent. In particular, since v′′ is tempered, we thus conclude that (v′)γ is
tempered. Thus, v′, (v′)γ are tempered, so γ ∈Πtp
G , as desired. ⃝
Next, relative to the notation “C”, “N” and related terminology concerning
commensurators and normalizers discussed, for instance, in [SemiAnbd], §0; [Com-
bGC], §0, we have the following result.
Proposition 2.2. (Commensurators of Decomposition Subgroups As-
sociated to Sub-semi-graphs) In the notation of the above discussion, ΠH (re-
spectively, Πtp
H) is commensurably terminal in ΠG (respectively, ΠG [hence, also
in Πtp
G ]). In particular, Πtp
G is commensurably terminal in ΠG.
Proof. First, letusobservethatbyallowing, inProposition2.1, Λtorangeoverthe
open subgroups of any verticial [hence, in particular, nontrivial compact!] subgroup
of Πtp
G , we conclude from Proposition 2.1 that
Πtp
G is commensurably terminal in ΠG
46 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
— cf. Remark 2.2.2 below. In particular, by applying this fact to H[cf. the discus-
sion preceding Proposition 2.1], we conclude that Πtp
H is commensurably terminal
in ΠH. Next, let us observe that it is immediate from the definitions that
Πtp
H ⊆CΠtp
G (Πtp
H) ⊆CΠG (Πtp
H) ⊆CΠG (ΠH)
[where we think of ΠH, ΠG, respectively, as the pro-Σ completions of Πtp
H, Πtp
G ].
On the other hand, by the evident pro-Σ analogue of [SemiAnbd], Corollary 2.7,
(i) [cf. also the argument involving gluing of abelian coverings in the discussion
preceding Proposition 2.1], we have CΠG (ΠH) = ΠH. Thus, by the commensurable
terminality of Πtp
H in ΠH, we conclude that
Πtp
H ⊆CΠG (Πtp
H) ⊆CΠH(Πtp
H) = Πtp
H
— as desired. ⃝
Remark 2.2.1. It follows immediately from the theory of [SemiAnbd] [cf., e.g.,
[SemiAnbd], Corollary 2.7, (i)] that, in fact, Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 can be proven
for much more general semi-graphs of anabelioids Gthan the sort of Gthat appears
in the above discussion. We leave the routine details of such generalizations to the
interested reader.
Remark 2.2.2. Recall that when Σ = Primes, the fact that
Πtp
G is normally terminal in ΠG
may also be derived from the fact that any nonabelian finitely generated free group
is normally terminal [cf. [Andr´ e], Lemma 3.2.1; [SemiAnbd], Lemma 6.1, (i)] in its
profinite completion. In particular, the proof of the commensurable terminality of
Πtp
G in ΠG that is given in the proof of Proposition 2.2 may be thought of as a new
proof of this normal terminality that does not require one to invoke [Andr´ e], Lemma
3.2.1, whichisessentiallyanimmediateconsequenceoftheratherdiﬃcultconjugacy
separability result given in [Stb1], Theorem 1. This relation of Proposition 2.1 to
the theory of [Stb1] is interesting in light of the discrete analogue given in Theorem
2.6 below of [the “tempered version of Theorem 2.6” constituted by] Proposition
2.4 [which is essentially a formal consequence of Proposition 2.1].
Now let k be an MLF, k an algebraic closure of k, Gk

hyperbolic curve over k that admits stable reduction over the ring of integers Ok of
k. Write

by the intersection of the kernels of all continuous surjections of πtp

∈Σ by a discrete free group of finite rank; πtp
1 (X) Πtp
X is the quotient of πtp
1 (X)
determined by the kernel of the quotient of πtp
1 (Xk) Δtp
X. Write ΔX for the
pro-Σ [i.e., maximal pro-Σ quotient of the profinite] fundamental group of Xk; ΠX
for the quotient of the profinite fundamental group of X by the subgroup of the
profinite fundamental group of Xk that determines the quotient ΔX. Thus, since
discrete free groups of finite rank inject into their pro-l completions for any prime
number l [cf., e.g., [RZ], Proposition 3.3.15], we have natural inclusions
Πtp
X → ΠX, Δtp
X → ΔX
[cf., e.g., [SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.6, (iii), as well as Remark 2.5.3, (ii), (E7),
of the present paper, when Σ = Primes]; ΔX may be identified with the pro-Σ
completion of Δtp
X; ΠX is generated by the images of Πtp
X and ΔX.
Now suppose that the residue characteristic p of k is not contained in Σ;
that the semi-graph of anabelioids Gof the above discussion is the pro-Σ semi-graph
of anabelioids associated to the geometric special fiber of the stable model X of X
over Ok [cf., e.g., [SemiAnbd], Example 3.10]; and that the sub-semi-graph H ⊆G
is stabilized by the natural action of Gk on G. Thus, we have natural surjections
Δtp
X Πtp
G ; ΔX ΠG
of topological groups.
Corollary 2.3. (Subgroups of Tempered Fundamental Groups Associ-
ated to Sub-semi-graphs) In the notation of the above discussion:
(i) The closed subgroups
Δtp
def = Δtp
X,H
X ×Πtp
G
Πtp
H ⊆ Δtp
X; ΔX,H

X, ΔX determine natural outer actions of Gk on Δtp
X,H, ΔX,H.
(ii) The closure of Δtp
X,H ⊆Δtp
X ⊆ΔX in ΔX is equal to ΔX,H.
(iii) Suppose that [at least] one of the following conditions holds: (a) Σ contains
a prime number l / ∈Σ {p}; (b) Σ = Primes. Then ΔX,H is slim. In particular,
the natural outer actions of Gk on Δtp
X,H, ΔX,H [cf. (i)] determine natural exact
sequences of center-free topological groups [cf. (ii); the slimness of ΔX,H;

X,H, ΠX,H are defined so as to render the sequences exact.
(iv) Suppose that the hypothesis of (iii) holds. Then the images of the natural
inclusions Πtp
X,H →Πtp
X, ΠX,H →ΠX are commensurably terminal.
48 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
(v) We have: ΔX,H Δtp
X = Δtp
X,H ⊆ΔX.
(vi) Let
Ix ⊆Δtp
X (respectively, Ix ⊆ΔX)
be an inertia group associated to a cusp x of X. Write ξ for the cusp of the stable
model X corresponding to x. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(a) Ix lies in a Δtp
X- (respectively, ΔX-) conjugate of Δtp
X,H (respectively,
ΔX,H);
(b) ξ meets an irreducible component of the special fiber of X that is con-
tained in H.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from Proposition 2.2. Assertion (ii) fol-
lows immediately from the definitions of the various tempered fundamental groups
involved, together with the following elementary observation: If G F is a surjec-
tion of finitely generated free discrete groups, which induces a surjection G F
between the respective pro-Σ completions [so, since discrete free groups of finite
rank inject into their pro-l completions for any prime number l [cf., e.g., [RZ],
Proposition 3.3.15], we think of G and F as subgroups of G and F, respectively],
then H def = Ker(G F) is dense in H def = Ker(G F), relative to the pro-Σ topol-
ogy of G. Indeed, let ι : F →G be a section of the given surjection G F [which
exists since F is free]. Then if {gi}i∈N is a sequence of elements of G that converges,
in the pro-Σ topology of G, to a given element h ∈H, and maps to a sequence of
elements {fi}i∈N of F [which necessarily converges, in the pro-Σ topology of F, to
the identity element 1 ∈F], then one verifies immediately that {gi·ι(fi)−1}i∈N is
a sequence of elements of H that converges, in the pro-Σ topology of G, to h. This
completes the proof of the observation and hence of assertion (ii).
Next, weconsiderassertion(iii). Inthefollowing, wegive, ineﬀect, two distinct
proofs of the slimness of ΔX,H: one is elementary, but requires one to assume that
condition (a) holds; the other depends on the highly nontrivial theory of [Tama2]
and requires one to assume that condition (b) holds. If condition (a) holds, then
let us set Σ∗ def = Σ {l}. If condition (b) holds, but condition (a) does not hold [so
Σ = Primes = Σ {p}], then let us set Σ∗ def = Σ. Thus, in either case, p ̸∈Σ∗, and
Σ ⊆Σ∗ ⊆Σ.
Let J ⊆ΔX be a normal open subgroup. Write JH
def
= J ΔX,H; J J∗ for
the maximal pro-Σ∗ quotient; J∗
H ⊆J∗ for the image of JH in J∗. Now suppose that
α ∈ΔX,H commutes with JH. Let v be a vertex of the dual graph of the geometric
special fiber of a stable model XJ of the covering XJ of Xk determined by J. Write
Jv ⊆J for the decomposition group [well-defined up to conjugation in J] associated
to v; J∗
v ⊆J∗ for the image of Jv in J∗. Then let us observe that
(†) there exists an open subgroup J0 ⊆ΔX which is independent of J, v,
and α such that if J ⊆J0, then for arbitrary v [and α] as above, it holds
that J∗
v J∗
H (⊆J∗) is infinite and nonabelian.
Indeed, suppose that condition (a) holds. Now it follows immediately from the
definitions that the image of the homomorphism Jv ⊆J ⊆ΔX ΠG is pro-Σ; in
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 49
particular, since l ̸∈Σ, and Ker(Jv ⊆J ⊆ΔX ΠG) ⊆Jv JH, it follows that
Jv JH, hence also J∗
v J∗
H, surjects onto the maximal pro-l quotient of Jv, which
is isomorphic to the pro-l completion of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic
Riemann surface, hence [as is well-known] is infinite and nonabelian [so we may
def
take J0
= ΔX]. Now suppose that condition (b) holds, but condition (a) does
not hold. Then it follows immediately from [Tama2], Theorem 0.2, (v), that, for
an appropriate choice of J0, if J ⊆J0, then every v corresponds to an irreducible
component that either maps to a point in X or contains a node that maps to a
smooth point of X. In particular, it follows that for every choice of v, there exists
at least one pro-Σ, torsion-free, pro-cyclic subgroup F ⊆Jv that lies in Ker(Jv ⊆
J ⊆ΔX ΠG) ⊆Jv JH and, moreover, maps injectively into J∗. Thus, we
obtain an injection F →J∗
v J∗
H; a similar statement holds when F is replaced by
any Jv-conjugate of F. Moreover, it follows from the well-known structure of the
pro-Σ completion of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic Riemann surface [such
as J∗
v] that the image of the Jv-conjugates of such a group F topologically generate
a closed subgroup of J∗
v J∗
H which is infinite and nonabelian. This completes the
proof of (†).
Next, let us observe that it follows by applying either [AbsTopII], Proposition
1.3, (iv), or [NodNon], Proposition 3.9, (i), to the various ΔX-conjugates in J∗ of
J∗
v J∗
H as in (†) that the fact that α commutes with J∗
v J∗
H implies that α fixes
v. If condition (a) holds, then the fact that conjugation by α on the maximal pro-l
quotient of Jv [which, as we saw above, is a quotient of J∗
v J∗
H] is trivial implies
[cf. the argument concerning the inertia group “Iv ⊆Dv” in the latter portion
of the proof of [SemiAnbd], Corollary 3.11] that α not only fixes v, but also acts
trivially on the irreducible component of the special fiber of XJ determined by v;
since v as in (†) is arbitrary, we thus conclude that α acts on the abelianization
(J∗)ab of J∗ as a unipotent automorphism of finite order, hence that α acts trivially
on (J∗)ab; since J as in (†) is arbitrary, we thus conclude [cf., e.g., the proof of
[Config], Proposition 1.4] that α is the identity element, as desired. Now suppose
that condition (b) holds, but condition (a) does not hold. Then since J and v as
in (†) are arbitrary, we thus conclude again from [Tama2], Theorem 0.2, (v), that
α fixes not only v, but also every closed point on the irreducible component of the
special fiber of XJ determined by v, hence that α acts trivially on this irreducible
component. Again since J and v as in (†) are arbitrary, we thus conclude that
α is the identity element, as desired. This completes the proof of assertion (iii).
In light of the exact sequences of assertion (iii), assertion (iv) follows immediately
from assertion (i). Assertion (vi) follows immediately from a similar argument to
the argument applied in the proof of [CombGC], Proposition 1.5, (i), by passing to
pro-Σ completions.
Finally, it follows immediately from the definitions of the various tempered
fundamental groups involved that to verify assertion (v), it suﬃces to verify the
following analogue of assertion (v) for a nonabelian finitely generated free discrete
group G: for any finitely generated subgroup F ⊆G, if we use the notation “∧”
to denote the pro-Σ completion, then F G= F. But to verify this assertion
concerning G, it follows immediately from [SemiAnbd], Corollary 1.6, (ii), that we
may assume without loss of generality that the inclusion F ⊆G admits a splitting
G F [i.e., such that the composite F →G F is the identity on F], in which
50 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
case the desired equality “F G= F” follows immediately. This completes the
proof of assertion (v), and hence of Corollary 2.3. ⃝
Next, we observe the following arithmetic analogue of Proposition 2.1.
Proposition 2.4. (Profinite Conjugates of Nontrivial Arithmetic Com-
pact Subgroups) In the notation of the above discussion:
(i) Let Λ ⊆Δtp
X be a nontrivial pro-Σ compact subgroup, γ ∈ΠX an
element such that γ·Λ·γ−1 ⊆Δtp
X [or, equivalently, Λ ⊆γ−1
·Δtp
X·γ]. Then
γ ∈Πtp
X.
(ii) Suppose that Σ = Primes. Let Λ ⊆ Πtp
X be a [nontrivial] compact
subgroup whose image in Gk is open, γ ∈ΠX an element such that γ·Λ·γ−1 ⊆
Πtp
X [or, equivalently, Λ ⊆γ−1
·Πtp
X·γ]. Then γ ∈Πtp
X.
(iii) Δtp
X (respectively, Πtp
X) is commensurably terminal in ΔX (respec-
tively, ΠX).
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). We begin by observing that since [as is
well-known — cf., e.g., [Config], Remark 1.2.2] ΔX is strongly torsion-free, it follows
that there exists a finite index characteristic open subgroup J ⊆Δtp
X such that, if
we write GJ for the pro-Σ semi-graph of anabelioids associated to the special fiber of
the stable model [i.e., over the ring of integers Ok of k] of the finite´ etale covering of
X ×k k determined by J, then J Λ has nontrivial image in the pro-Σ completion
of the abelianization of J, hence in Πtp
GJ [since, as is well-known, our assumption
that p / ∈Σ implies that the surjection J Πtp
GJ induces an isomorphism between
the pro-Σ completions of the respective abelianizations]. Since the quotient Πtp
X
surjects onto Gk, and J is open of finite index in Δtp
X, we may assume without loss
of generality that γ lies in the closure J of J in ΠX. Since J Λ has nontrivial
image in Πtp
GJ , it thus follows from Proposition 2.1 [applied to GJ] that the image
of γ via the natural surjection on pro-Σ completions J ΠGJ lies in Πtp
GJ . Since,
by allowing J to vary, Πtp
X (respectively, ΠX) may be written as an inverse limit of
the topological groups Πtp
X/Ker(J Πtp
GJ ) (respectively, ΠX/Ker(J ΠGJ )), we
thus conclude that [the original] γ lies in Πtp
X, as desired.
Next, we consider assertion (ii). First, let us observe that it follows from a sim-
ilar argument to the argument applied to prove Proposition 2.1 — where, instead of
applying [SemiAnbd], Theorem 3.7, (iii), we apply its arithmetic analogue, namely,
[SemiAnbd], Theorem 5.4, (ii); [SemiAnbd], Example 5.6 [cf. also Remark 2.5.3,
(ii), (E5), (E7), ofthe presentpaper] —thatthe imageofγ in ΠX/Ker(ΔX ΠG∗)
lies in Πtp
X/Ker(Δtp
X Πtp
G∗), where [by invoking the hypothesis that Σ = Primes]
we take G∗ to be a semi-graph of anabelioids as in [SemiAnbd], Example 5.6, i.e.,
the semi-graph of anabelioids whose finite ´ etale coverings correspond to arbitrary
admissible coverings of the geometric special fiber of the stable model X. Here, we
note that when one applies either [AbsTopII], Proposition 1.3, (iv), or [NodNon],
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 51
Proposition 3.9, (i) — after, say, restricting the outer action of Gk on Πtp
G∗ to a
closed pro-Σ subgroup of the inertia group Ik of Gk that maps isomorphically onto
the maximal pro-Σ quotient of Ik — to the vertices “v′′”, “(v′)γ”, one may only
conclude that these two vertices either coincide, are adjacent, or admit a common
adjacent vertex; but this is still suﬃcient to conclude the temperedness of “(v′)γ”
fromthatof“v′′”. Now[justasintheproofofassertion(i)]byapplying[theevident
analogue of] this observation to the quotients Πtp
X Πtp
X/Ker(J Πtp
G∗
J ) — where
J ⊆Δtp
X is a finite index characteristic open subgroup, and G∗
J is the semi-graph of
anabelioids whose finite´ etale coverings correspond to arbitrary admissible coverings
of the special fiber of the stable model over Ok of the finite ´ etale covering of X×k k
determined by J — we conclude that γ ∈Πtp
X, as desired.
Finally, we consider assertion (iii). Just as in the proof of Proposition 2.2, the
commensurable terminality of Δtp
X in ΔX follows immediately from assertion (i),
by allowing, in assertion (i), Λ to range over the open subgroups of a pro-Σ Sylow
subgroup of a decomposition group ⊆Δtp
X associated to an irreducible component
of the special fiber of X. The commensurable terminality of Πtp
X in ΠX then follows
immediately from the commensurable terminality of Δtp
X in ΔX. ⃝
Remark 2.4.1. Thus, when Σ = Primes, the proof given above of Proposition
2.4, (iii), yields a new proof of [Andr´ e], Corollary 6.2.2 [cf. also [SemiAnbd], Lemma
6.1, (ii), (iii)] which is independent of [Andr´ e], Lemma 3.2.1, hence also of [Stb1],
Theorem 1 [cf. the discussion of Remark 2.2.2].
Corollary 2.5. (Profinite Conjugates of Tempered Decomposition and
Inertia Groups) In the notation of the above discussion, suppose further that
Σ = Primes. Then every decomposition group in ΠX (respectively, inertia
group in ΠX) associated to a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a cusp of
X) is contained in Πtp
X if and only if it is a decomposition group in Πtp
X (respectively,
inertia group in Πtp
X) associated to a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a
cusp of X). Moreover, a ΠX-conjugate of Πtp
X contains a decomposition group in
Πtp
X (respectively, inertia group in Πtp
X) associated to a closed point or cusp of X
(respectively, to a cusp of X) if and only if it is equal to Πtp
X.
Proof. Let Dx ⊆Πtp
X be the decomposition group in Πtp
X associated to a closed
def
point or cusp x of X; Ix
= Dx Δtp
X. Then the decomposition groups of ΠX
associated to x are precisely the ΠX-conjugates of Dx; the decomposition groups
of Πtp
X associated to x are precisely the Πtp
X-conjugates of Dx. Since Dx is compact
and surjects onto an open subgroup of Gk, it thus follows from Proposition 2.4,
(ii), that a ΠX-conjugate of Dx is contained in Πtp
X if and only if it is, in fact, a
Πtp
X-conjugate of Dx, and that a ΠX-conjugate of Πtp
X contains Dx if and only if
it is, in fact, equal to Πtp
X. In a similar vein, when x is a cusp of X [so Ix
∼
= Z],
it follows — i.e., by applying Proposition 2.4, (i), to the unique maximal pro-Σ
subgroup of Ix — that a ΠX-conjugate of Ix is contained in Πtp
X if and only if it is,
in fact, a Πtp
X-conjugate of Ix, and that a ΠX-conjugate of Πtp
X contains Ix if and
only if it is, in fact, equal to Πtp
X. This completes the proof of Corollary 2.5. ⃝
52 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
Remark 2.5.1. The content of Corollary 2.5 may be regarded as a sort of [very
weak!] version of the “Section Conjecture” of anabelian geometry — i.e., as the
assertion that certain sections of the tempered fundamental group [namely, those
that arise from geometric sections of the profinite fundamental group] are geometric
as sections of the tempered fundamental group. This point of view is reminiscent
of the point of view of [SemiAnbd], Remark 6.9.1. Perhaps one way of summarizing
this circle of ideas is to state that one may think of
(i) the classification of maximal compact subgroups of tempered fundamental
groups given in [SemiAnbd], Theorem 3.7, (iv); [SemiAnbd], Theorem 5.4,
(ii) [cf. also Remark 2.5.3, (ii), (E5), (E7), of the present paper], or, for
that matter,
(ii) the more elementary fact that “any finite group acting on a tree [without
inversion] fixes at least one vertex” [cf. [SemiAnbd], Lemma 1.8, (ii)] from
which these results of [SemiAnbd] are derived
as a sort of combinatorial version of the Section Conjecture.
Remark 2.5.2. Ultimately, when we apply Corollary 2.5 in [IUTchII], it will
only be necessary to apply the portion of Corollary 2.5 that concerns inertia groups
of cusps, i.e., the portion whose proof only requires the use of Proposition 2.4,
(i), which is essentially an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.1. That is to
say, the theory developed in [IUTchII] [and indeed throughout the present series of
papers] will never require the application of Proposition 2.4, (ii), i.e., whose proof
depends on a slightly more complicated version of the proof of Proposition 2.1.
Remark 2.5.3. In light of the importance of the theory of [SemiAnbd] in the
present §2, we pause to discuss certain minor oversights on the part of the author
in the exposition of [SemiAnbd].
(i) Certain pathologies occur in the theory of tempered fundamental groups
if one does not impose suitable countability hypotheses. In order to discuss these
countability hypotheses, it will be convenient to introduce some terminology as
follows:
(T1) We shall say that a tempered group is Galois-countable if its topol-
ogy admits a countable basis. We shall say that a connected temperoid
is Galois-countable if it arises from a Galois-countable tempered group.
We shall say that a temperoid is Galois-countable if it arises from a col-
lection of Galois-countable connected temperoids. We shall say that a
connected quasi-temperoid is Galois-countable if it arises from a Galois-
countable connected temperoid. We shall say that a quasi-temperoid is
Galois-countableifitarisesfromacollectionofGalois-countableconnected
quasi-temperoids.
(T2) We shall say that a semi-graph of anabelioids Gis Galois-countable if it
is countable, and, moreover, admits a countable collection of finite ´ etale
coverings {Gi →G}i∈I such that for any finite ´ etale covering H→G,
there exists an i ∈I such that the base-changed covering H×G Gi →Gi
splits over the constituent anabelioid associated to each component of [the
underlying semi-graph of] Gi.
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 53
(T3) We shall say that a semi-graph of anabelioids Gis strictly coherent if it
is coherent [cf. [SemiAnbd], Definition 2.3, (iii)], and, moreover, each of
the profinite groups associated to components c of [the underlying semi-
graph of] G[cf. the final sentence of [SemiAnbd], Definition 2.3, (iii)] is
topologically generated by N generators, for some positive integer N that
is independent of c. In particular, it follows that if Gis finite and coherent,
then it is strictly coherent.
(T4) One verifies immediately that every strictly coherent, countable semi-
graph of anabelioids is Galois-countable.
(T5) One verifies immediately that if, in [SemiAnbd], Remark 3.2.1, one as-
sumesinaddition thatthetemperoid XisGalois-countable, thenitfollows
that its associated tempered fundamental group πtemp
1 (X) is well-defined
and Galois-countable.
(T6) One verifies immediately that if, in the discussion of the paragraph
preceding [SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.6, one assumes in addition that the
semi-graph of anabelioids Gis Galois-countable, then it follows that its
associated tempered fundamental group πtemp
1 (G) and temperoid Btemp(G)
are well-defined and Galois-countable.
Here, we note that, in (T5) and (T6), the Galois-countability assumption is nec-
essary in order to ensure that the index sets of “universal covering pro-objects”
implicit in the definition of the tempered fundamental group may to be taken to
be countable. This countability of the index sets involved implies that the various
objects that constitute such a universal covering pro-object admit a compatible sys-
tem of basepoints, i.e., that the obstruction to the existence of such a compatible
”
system — which may be thought of as an element of a sort of “nonabelian R1 lim ←−
— vanishes. In order to define the tempered fundamental group in an intrinsi-
cally meaningful fashion, it is necessary to know the existence of such a compatible
system of basepoints.
(ii) The eﬀects of the omission of Galois-countability hypotheses in [SemiAnbd],
§3 [cf. the discussion of (i)], on the remainder of [SemiAnbd], as well as on subse-
quent papers of the author, may be summarized as follows:
(E1) Firstofall, weobservethatalltopologicalsubquotientsofabsolute Galois
groups of fields of countable cardinality are Galois-countable.
(E2) Also, we observe that if k is a field whose absolute Galois group is Galois-
countable, and U is a nonempty open subscheme of a connected proper
k-scheme X that arises as the underlying scheme of a log scheme that is
log smooth over k [where we regard Spec(k) as equipped with the trivial
log structure], and whose interior is equal to U, then the tamely ramified
arithmetic fundamental group of U [i.e., that arises by considering finite
´ etale coverings of U with tame ramification over the divisors that lie in
the complement of U in X] is itself Galois-countable [cf., e.g., [AbsTopI],
Proposition 2.2].
(E3) Next, we observe, with regard to [SemiAnbd], Examples 2.10, 3.10,
and 5.6, that the tempered groups and temperoids that appear in these
Examples are Galois-countable [cf. (E1), (E2)], while the semi-graphs of
54 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
anabelioids that appear in these Examples are strictly coherent [cf. item
(T3) of (i)], hence [cf. item (T4) of (i)] Galois-countable. In particular,
there is no eﬀect on the theory of objects discussed in these Examples.
(E4) It follows immediately from (E3) that there is no eﬀect on [SemiAnbd],
§6.
(E5) It follows immediately from items (T3), (T4) of (i), together with the
assumptions of finiteness and coherence in the discussion of the para-
graph immediately preceding [SemiAnbd], Definition 4.2, the assumption
of coherence in [SemiAnbd], Definition 5.1, (i), and the assumption of
[SemiAnbd], Definition 5.1, (i), (d), that there is no eﬀect on [SemiAnbd],
§4, §5. [Here, we note that since the notion of a tempered covering of a
semi-graph of anabelioids is only defined in the case where the semi-graph
of anabelioids is countable, it is implicit in [SemiAnbd], Proposition 5.2,
and [SemiAnbd], Definition 5.3, that the semi-graphs of anabelioids under
consideration are countable.]
(E6) There is no eﬀect on [SemiAnbd], §1, §2, or the Appendix of [SemiAnbd],
since tempered fundamental groups are never discussed in these portions
of [SemiAnbd].
(E7) In the Definitions/Propositions/Theorems/Corollaries of [SemiAnbd]
that are numbered 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, one must assume
that all tempered groups, temperoids, and semi-graphs of anabelioids that
appear are Galois-countable. On the other hand, it follows immediately
from (E1), (E2), and (E3) that there is no eﬀect on the remaining portions
of [SemiAnbd], §3.
(E8) In [QuCnf] and [FrdII], one must assume that all tempered groups and
[quasi-]temperoids that appear are Galois-countable.
(E9) There is no eﬀect on any papers of the author other than [SemiAnbd]
and the papers discussed in (E8).
(iii) The assertion stated in the second display of [SemiAnbd], Remark 2.4.2,
is false as stated. [The automorphisms of the semi-graphs of anabelioids in [Semi-
Anbd], Example 2.10, that arise from “Dehn twists” constitute a well-known coun-
terexample to this assertion.] This assertion should be replaced by the following
slightly modified version of this assertion:
The isomorphism classes of the φv completely determine the isomorphism
class of each of the φe, as well as each isomorphism φb, up to composi-
tion with an automorphism of the composite 1-morphism of anabelioids
Ge →Hf →Hw that arises from an automorphism of the 1-morphism of
anabelioids Ge →Hf.
Also, in the discussion following this assertion [as well as the various places where
this discussion is applied, i.e., [SemiAnbd], Remark 3.5.2; the second paragraph of
[SemiAnbd], §4; [SemiAnbd], Definition 5.1, (iv)], it is necessary to assume further
that the semi-graphs of anabelioids that appear satisfy the condition that every
edge abuts to at least one vertex.
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 55
(iv) The phrase “is Galois” at the end of the first sentence of the proof of
[SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.2, should read “is a countable coproduct of Galois ob-
jects”.
(v)In thefirstsentenceof[SemiAnbd], Definition3.5, (ii), the phrase“Suppose
that” should read “Suppose that each connected component of”; the phrase “splits
the restriction of” should read “splits the restriction of this connected component
of”.
(vi) In order to carry out the argument stated in the proof of [SemiAnbd],
Proposition 5.2, (i), it is necessary to strengthen the conditions (c) and (d) of
[SemiAnbd], Definition 5.1, (i), as follows. This strengthening of the conditions (c)
and (d) of [SemiAnbd], Definition 5.1, (i), has no eﬀect either on the remainder
of [SemiAnbd] or on subsequent papers of the author. Suppose that G is as in
[SemiAnbd], Definition5.1, (i). Thenwebeginbymakingthefollowingobservation:
(O1) Suppose that Gis finite. Then Gadmits a cofinal, countable collection
of connected finite ´ etale Galois coverings {Gi →G}i∈I, each of which is
characteristic [i.e., any pull-back of the covering via an element of Aut(G)
is isomorphic to the original covering]. [For instance, one verifies immedi-
ately, by applying the finiteness and coherence of G, that such a collection
of coverings may be obtained by considering, for n a positive integer, the
composite of all connected finite ´ etale Galois coverings of degree ≤n.] We
may assume, without loss of generality, that this collection of coverings
arises from a projective system, which we denote by G. Thus, we obtain a
natural exact sequence
1 −→ Gal(G/G) −→ Aut(G/G) −→ Aut(G) −→ 1
— where we write “Aut(G/G)” for the group of pairs of compatible auto-
morphisms of Gand G.
This observation (O1) has the following immediate consequence:
(O2) Suppose that we are in the situation of (O1). Consider, for i ∈I, the
finite index normal subgroup
Auti(G/G) ⊆ Aut(G/G)
of elements of Aut(G/G) that induce the identity automorphism on the
underlying semi-graph Gi of Gi, as well as on Gal(Gi/G). Then one
verifies immediately [from the definition of a semi-graph of anabelioids;
cf. also [SemiAnbd], Proposition 2.5, (i)] that the intersection of the
Auti(G/G), for i ∈ I, is = {1}. Thus, the Auti(G/G), for i ∈ I, de-
termine a natural profinite topology on Aut(G/G) and hence also on the
quotient Aut(G), which is easily seen to be compatible with the profinite
topology on Gal(G/G) and, moreover, independent of the choice of G.
The new version of the condition (c) of [SemiAnbd], Definition 5.1, (i), that we
wish to consider is the following:
(cnew) The action of H on G is trivial; the resulting homomorphism H →
Aut(G[c]), where c ranges over the components [i.e., vertices and edges]
56 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
of G, is continuous [i.e., relative to the natural profinite group topology
defined in (O2) on Aut(G[c])].
It is immediate that (cnew) implies (c). Moreover, we observe in passing that:
(O3) In fact, since H is topologically finitely generated [cf. [SemiAnbd], Defi-
nition 5.1, (i), (a)], it holds [cf. [NS], Theorem 1.1] that every finite index
subgroup of H is open in H. Thus, the conditions (c) and (cnew) in fact
hold automatically.
The new version of the condition (d) of [SemiAnbd], Definition 5.1, (i), that we
wish to consider is the following:
(dnew) There is a finite set C∗ of components [i.e., vertices and edges] of G
such that for every component c of G, there exists a c∗ ∈C∗ and an
isomorphism of semi-graphs of anabelioids G[c]∼ →G[c∗] that is compatible
with the action of H on both sides.
It is immediate that (dnew) implies (d). The reason that, in the context of the
proof of [SemiAnbd], Proposition 5.2, (i), it is necessary to consider the stronger
conditions (cnew) and (dnew) is as follows. It suﬃces to show that, given a connected
finite ´ etale covering G′ →G, after possibly replacing H by an open subgroup of
H, the action of H on Glifts to an action on G′ that satisfies the conditions of
[SemiAnbd], Definition 5.1, (i). Such a lifting of the action of H on Gto an action
on the portion of G′ that lies over the vertices of G follows in a straightforward
manner from the original conditions (a), (b), (c), and (d). On the other hand,
in order to conclude that such a lifting is [after possibly replacing H by an open
subgroup of H] compatible with the gluing conditions arising from the structure of
G′ over the edges of G, it is necessary to assume further that the “component-wise
versions (cnew), (dnew)” of the original “vertex-wise conditions (c), (d)” hold. This
issue is closely related to the issue discussed in (iii) above.
Finally, we observe that Proposition 2.4, Corollary 2.5 admit the following
discrete analogues, which may be regarded as generalizations of [Andr´ e], Lemma
3.2.1 [cf. Theorem 2.6 below in the case where H= F= G is free]; [EtTh], Lemma
2.17, (i).
Theorem 2.6. (Profinite Conjugates of Discrete Subgroups) Let F be
a group that contains a subgroup of finite index G ⊆F such that G is either a
free discrete group of finite rank or an orientable surface group [i.e., a
fundamental group of a compact orientable topological surface of genus ≥2]; H ⊆F
an infinite subgroup. Since F is residually finite [cf., e.g., [Config], Proposition 7.1,
(ii)], we shall write H,G ⊆F ⊆F, where F denotes the profinite completion of
F. Let γ ∈F be an element such that
γ·H·γ−1 ⊆F [or, equivalently, H ⊆γ−1
·F·γ].
def
Write HG
= H G. Then γ ∈F·NF(HG), i.e., γ·HG·γ−1 = δ·HG·δ−1, for
some δ ∈F. If, moreover, HG is nonabelian, then γ ∈F.
Proof. Let us first consider the case where HG is abelian. In this case, it follows
from Lemma 2.7, (iv), below, that HG is cyclic. Thus, by applying Lemma 2.7,
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 57
(ii), it follows that by replacing G by an appropriate finite index subgroup of G,
we may assume that the natural composite homomorphism HG →G Gab is a
split injection. In particular, by Lemma 2.7, (v), we conclude that NG(HG) = HG,
where we write HG for the closure of HG in the profinite completion G of G. Next,
let us observe that by multiplying γ on the left by an appropriate element of F, we
may assume that γ ∈G. Thus, we have γ·HG·γ−1 ⊆F G= G. Next, let us
recall that G is conjugacy separable. Indeed, this is precisely the content of [Stb1],
Theorem 1, when G is free; [Stb2], Theorem 3.3, when G is an orientable surface
group. Since G is conjugacy separable, it follows that γ·HG·γ−1 = ϵ·HG·ϵ−1 for
some ϵ ∈G, so γ ∈G·NG(HG) = G·HG ⊆F·NF(HG), as desired. This completes
the proof of Theorem 2.6 when HG is abelian.
Thus, let us assume for the remainder of the proof of Theorem 2.6 that HG is
nonabelian. Then, byapplyingLemma 2.7, (iii), it followsthat, after replacing Gby
an appropriate finite index subgroup of G, we may assume that there exist elements
x,y ∈HG that generate a free abelian subgroup of rank two M ⊆Gab such that
the injection M →Gab splits. Write Hx,Hy ⊆HG for the subgroups generated,
respectively, by x and y; Hx,Hy ⊆G for the respective closures of Hx, Hy. Then
by Lemma 2.7, (v), we conclude that NG(Hx) = Hx, NG(Hy) = Hy. Next, let us
observe that by multiplying γ on the left by an appropriate element of F, we may
assume that γ ∈G. Thus, we have γ·HG·γ−1 ⊆F G= G. In particular, by
applying the portion of Theorem 2.6 that has already been proven to the subgroups
Hx,Hy ⊆G, we conclude that γ ∈G·NG(Hx) = G·Hx, γ ∈G·NG(Hy) = G·Hy.
Thus, byprojectingtoGab, andapplyingthefactthatM isofrank two, weconclude
that γ ∈G, as desired. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.6. ⃝
Remark 2.6.1. Note that in the situation of Theorem 2.6, if HG is abelian, then
— unlike the tempered case discussed in Proposition 2.4! — it is not necessarily
the case that F= γ−1
·F·γ.
Lemma 2.7. (Well-known Properties of Free Groups and Orientable
Surface Groups) Let G be a group as in Theorem 2.6. Write G for the profinite
completion of G. Then:
(i) Any subgroup of G generated by two elements of G is free.
(ii) Let x ∈G be an element ̸= 1. Then there exists a finite index subgroup
G1 ⊆G such that x ∈G1, and x has nontrivial image in the abelianization Gab
1
of G1.
(iii) Let x,y ∈ G be noncommuting elements of G. Then there exists a
finite index subgroup G1 ⊆G and a positive integer n such that xn,yn ∈G1, and
the images of xn and yn in the abelianization Gab
1 of G1 generate a free abelian
subgroup of rank two.
(iv) Any abelian subgroup of G is cyclic.
(v) Let T ⊆G be a closed subgroup such that there exists a continuous surjec-
tion of topological groups G Z that induces an isomorphism T∼
→Z. Then T is
normally terminal in G.
58 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
(vi) Suppose that G is nonabelian. Write N ⊆G for the kernel of the natural
surjection G Gab to the abelianization Gab of G. Then the centralizer ZG(N)
of N in G is trivial.
(vii) In the notation of (vi), let α be an automorphism of the profinite group
G that preserves and restricts to the identity on the subgroup N. Then α is the
identity automorphism of G.
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). If G is free, then assertion (i) follows
from the well-known fact that any subgroup of a free group is free. If G is an
orientable surface group, then assertion (i) follows immediately — i.e., by consid-
ering the noncompact covering of a compact surface that corresponds to an infinite
index subgroup of G of the sort discussed in assertion (i) — from a classical result
concerning the fundamental group of a noncompact surface due to Johansson [cf.
[Stl], p. 142; the discussion preceding [FRS], Theorem A1]. This completes the
proof of assertion (i). Next, we consider assertion (ii). Since G is residually finite
[cf., e.g., [Config], Proposition 7.1, (ii)], it follows that there exists a finite index
normal subgroup G0 ⊆G such that x ̸∈G0. Thus, it suﬃces to take G1 to be the
subgroup of G generated by G0 and x. This completes the proof of assertion (ii).
Next, we consider assertion (iii). By applying assertion (i) to the subgroup J
of G generated by x and y, it follows from the fact that x and y are noncommuting
elements of G that J is a free group of rank 2, hence that xa
·yb
̸= 1, for all
(a,b) ∈Z ×Z such that (a,b) ̸= (0,0). Next, let us recall the well-known fact
that the abelianization of any finite index subgroup of G is torsion-free. Thus,
by applying assertion (ii) to x and y, we conclude that there exists a finite index
subgroup G0 ⊆G and a positive integer m such that xm,ym ∈G0, and xm and ym
have nontrivial image in the abelianization Gab
0 of G0. Now suppose that xma
·ymb
lies in the kernel of the natural surjection G0 Gab
0 for some (a,b) ∈ Z ×Z
such that (a,b) ̸= (0,0). Since G is residually finite, and [as we observed above]
xma
·ymb
̸= 1, it follows, by applying assertion (ii) to G0, that there exists a finite
index subgroup G1 ⊆G0 and a positive integer n that is divisible by m such that
xn,yn,xma
·ymb ∈G1, and the image of xma
·ymb in Gab
1 is nontrivial. Since Gab
1
is torsion-free, it thus follows that the image of xna
·ynb in Gab
1 is nontrivial. On
the other hand, by considering the natural homomorphism Gab
1 →Gab
0 , we thus
conclude that the images of xn and yn in Gab
1 generate a free abelian subgroup of
rank two, as desired. This completes the proof of assertion (iii).
Next, we consider assertion (iv). By assertion (i), it follows that any abelian
subgroup of G generated by two elements is free, hence cyclic. In particular, we
conclude that any abelian subgroup J of G is equal to the union of the groups
that appear in some chain G1 ⊆G2 ⊆... ⊆G of cyclic subgroups of G. On
the other hand, by applying assertion (ii) to some generator of G1, it follows that
there exists a finite index subgroup G0 and a positive integer n such that Gn
j ⊆G0
for all j = 1,2,..., and, moreover, Gn
1 has nontrivial image in Gab
0 . Thus, by
considering the image in [the finitely generated abelian group] Gab
0 of the chain
of cyclic subgroups Gn
1 ⊆Gn
2 ⊆..., we conclude that this chain, hence also the
original chain G1 ⊆G2 ⊆..., must terminate. Thus, J is cyclic, as desired. This
completes the proof of assertion (iv).

Next, we consider assertion (v). By considering the surjection G Z, we con-
clude immediately that the normalizer NG(T) of T in G is equal to the centralizer
ZG(T) of T in G. If ZG(T) ̸= T, then it follows immediately that, for some prime
number l, there exists a closed [abelian] subgroup T1 ⊆ZG(T) containing the pro-l
portion of T such that there exists a continuous surjection Zl ×Zl T1 whose ker-
nel lies in l·(Zl ×Zl). In particular, one computes easily that the l-cohomological
dimension of T1 is ≥2. On the other hand, since T1 is of infinite index in G, it
follows immediately that there exists an open subgroup G1 ⊆G of G such that
T1 ⊆G1, and, moreover, there exists a continuous surjection φ : G1 Zl whose
kernel Ker(φ) contains T1. In particular, since the cohomology of T1 may be com-
puted as the direct limit of the cohomologies of open subgroups of G containing T1,
it follows immediately from the existence of φ, together with the well-known struc-
ture of the cohomology of open subgroups of G, that the l-cohomological dimension
of T1 is 1, a contradiction. This completes the proof of assertion (v).
Next, we consider assertion (vi). Write N ⊆G for the kernel of the natu-
ral surjection G Gab to the abelianization Gab of G. It follows immediately
from the “tautological universal property” of a free group or an orientable sur-
face group [i.e., regarded as the quotient of a free group by a single relation] that
N is not cyclic, hence by assertion (iv), that N is nonabelian. Thus, by asser-
tion (iii), there exist a finite index subgroup G1 ⊆G equipped with a surjection
β : G1 Z ×Z and elements x,y ∈ N G1 such that β(x) = (1,0) and
β(y) = (0,1). In particular, it follows from assertion (v) that the closed subgroups
Tx,Ty ⊆G topologically generated by x and y, respectively, are normally termi-
nal in the profinite completion G1 ⊆ G of G1. But this implies formally that
ZG(N) G1 ⊆ ZG1(Tx) ZG1(Ty) ⊆ Tx Ty = {1}[where the last equal-
ity follows from the existence of the surjection G1 Z×Z induced by β]. Since [as
is well-known] the abelianizations of all open subgroups of G are torsion-free, we
thus conclude that ZG(N) = {1}, as desired. This completes the proof of assertion
(vi). Finally, we consider assertion (vii). If x ∈G, y ∈N [so x·y·x−1 ∈N], then
x·y·x−1 = α(x·y·x−1) = α(x)·α(y)·α(x)−1 = α(x)·y·α(x)−1. We thus
conclude from assertion (vi) that α(x)·x−1 ∈ZG(N) = {1}, i.e., that α(x) = x.
This completes the proof of assertion (vii). ⃝
Corollary 2.8. (Subgroups of Topological Fundamental Groups of Com-
plex Hyperbolic Curves) Let Z be a hyperbolic curve over C. Write ΠZ for
the usual topological fundamental group of Z; ΠZ for the profinite completion of
ΠZ. Let H ⊆ΠZ be an infinite subgroup [such as a cuspidal inertia group!];
γ ∈ΠZ an element such that
γ·H·γ−1 ⊆ΠZ [or, equivalently, H ⊆γ−1
·ΠZ·γ].
Then γ ∈ΠZ·NΠZ (H), i.e., γ·H·γ−1 = δ·H·δ−1, for some δ ∈ΠZ. If, moreover,
H is nonabelian, then γ ∈ΠZ.
Remark 2.8.1. Corollary 2.8 is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.6. In
fact, in the present series of papers, we shall only apply Corollary 2.8 in the case
60 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
where Z is non-proper, and H is a cuspidal inertia group. In this case, the proof
of Theorem 2.6 may be simplified somewhat, but we chose to include the general
version given here, for the sake of completeness.

Section 3: Chains of Θ-Hodge Theaters
In the present §3, we construct chains of “Θ-Hodge theaters”. Each “Θ-Hodge
theater” is to be thought of as a sort of miniature model of the conventional
scheme-theoretic arithmetic geometry that surrounds the theta function.
This miniature model is formulated via the theory of Frobenioids [cf. [FrdI]; [FrdII];
[EtTh], §3, §4, §5]. On the other hand, the link [cf. Corollary 3.7, (i)] between
adjacent members of such chains is purely Frobenioid-theoretic, i.e., it lies outside
the framework of ring theory/scheme theory. It is these chains of Θ-Hodge theaters
that form the starting point of the theory of the present series of papers.
Definition 3.1. We shall refer to as initial Θ-data any collection of data
(F/F, XF, l, CK, V, Vbad
mod, ϵ)
that satisfies the following conditions:
(a) F is a number field such that √−1 ∈F; F is an algebraic closure of F.
Write GF
def = Gal(F/F).
(b) XF is a once-punctured elliptic curve [i.e., a hyperbolic curve of type
(1,1)] over F that admits stable reduction over all v ∈V(F)non. Write EF
for the elliptic curve over F determined by XF [so XF ⊆EF];
XF →CF
for the hyperbolic orbicurve [cf. §0] over F obtained by forming the stack-
theoretic quotient of XF by the unique F-involution [i.e., automorphism
of order two] “−1” of XF; Fmod ⊆F for the field of moduli [cf., e.g.,
[AbsTopIII], Definition 5.1, (ii)] of XF; Fsol ⊆F for the maximal solvable
def
= V(Fmod). Then
Vbad
mod ⊆Vmod
is a nonempty set of nonarchimedean valuations of Fmod of odd residue
characteristic such that XF has bad [i.e., multiplicative] reduction at the
elements of V(F) that lie over Vbad
mod ⊆Vmod. Write Vgood

“X” or “C”.] Here, we suppose further that the field extension F/Fmod
62 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
is Galois of degree prime to l, and that the 2·3-torsion points of EF are
rational over F.
(c) l is a prime number ≥5 such that the image of the outer homomorphism
GF →GL2(Fl)
determined by the l-torsion points of EF contains the subgroup SL2(Fl) ⊆
GL2(Fl); write K ⊆F for the finite Galois extension of F determined by
the kernel of this homomorphism. Also, we suppose that l is prime to the
[residue characteristics of the] elements of Vbad
mod, as well as to the orders
of the q-parameters of EF [i.e., in the terminology of [GenEll], Definition
3.3, the “local heights” of EF] at the primes of V(F)bad

that CK is completely determined, up to isomorphism over F, by CF.] In
particular, CK determines, up to K-isomorphism, a hyperbolic orbicurve

profinite groups “Π(−)” admit natural outer surjections onto the decom-

Cv is of type (1,Z/lZ)± [cf. [EtTh], Definition 2.5, (i)]. [Here, we note
that it follows from the portion of (b) concerning 2-torsion points that the

Remark 3.1.2.
(i) Observe that the open subgroup ΠXK ⊆ΠCK may be constructed group-
theoretically from the topological group ΠCK . Indeed, it follows immediately from
the construction of the coverings “X”, “C” in the discussion at the beginning
of [EtTh], §2 [cf. also [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.1.4, (i)], that the closed subgroup
ΔX ⊆ΠCK may be characterized by a rather simple explicit algorithm. Since the
decomposition groups of ΠCK
at the nonzero cusps — i.e., the cusps whose inertia
groups are contained in ΔX [cf. the discussion at the beginning of §1] — are also
group-theoretic [cf., e.g., [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, as well as Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the
present paper], the above observation follows immediately from the easily verified
fact that the image of any of these decomposition groups associated to nonzero
cusps coincides with the image of ΠXK
in ΠCK /ΔX.
(ii) In light of the observation of (i), it makes sense to adopt the following
convention:
Instead of applying the group-theoretic reconstruction algorithm of [Ab-
sTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf. also the discussion of [AbsTopIII], Remark
2.8.3], directly to ΠCK [or topological groups isomorphic to ΠCK ], we
shall apply this reconstruction algorithm to the open subgroup ΠXK ⊆
ΠCK
to reconstruct the function field of XK, equipped with its natural
Gal(XK/CK)∼
= ΠCK /ΠXK
-action.
Inthiscontext,weshallrefertothisapproachofapplying[AbsTopIII],Theorem1.9,
as the Θ-approach to [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9. Note that, for v ∈Vgood Vnon
(respectively, v ∈ Vbad), one may also adopt a “Θ-approach” to applying [Ab-
sTopIII], Theorem 1.9, to ΠC
v or [by applying Corollary 1.2] ΠX

(iii) Recall from the discussion at the beginning of [EtTh], §2, the tautological
extension

sTopIII],Remark1.10.1, (ii)], maybenaturally identifiedwithHom(H2(Δell
X ,Z),Z).
In particular, we obtain a tautological isomorphism
MX
∼
→(l·ΔΘ)
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 65
[i.e., since [ΔX : ΔX] = l]. In particular, we observe that if we write ΠCFmod
for the ´ etale fundamental group of the orbicurve CFmod discussed in Remark 3.1.7,
(i), below, then MX
∼
→(l·ΔΘ) may be regarded as a characteristic subquotient
of ΠCFmod , hence admits a natural conjugation action by ΠCFmod . From the point
of view of the theory of the present series of papers, the significance of the “Θ-
∼
approach” lies precisely in the existence of this tautological isomorphism MX
→(l·
ΔΘ), which will be applied in [IUTchII] at v ∈Vbad. That is to say, the Θ-approach
involves applying the reconstruction algorithm of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, via the
cyclotome MX, which may be identified, via the above tautological isomorphism,
with the cyclotome (l·ΔΘ), which plays a central role in the theory of [EtTh] —
cf., especially, the discussion of “cyclotomic rigidity” in [EtTh], Corollary 2.19, (i).
(iv) If one thinks of the prime number l as being “large”, then the role played
by the covering X in the above discussion of the “Θ-approach” is reminiscent of the
roleplayedbytheuniversal covering of a complex elliptic curve by the complex plane
in the holomorphic reconstruction theory of [AbsTopIII], §2 [cf., e.g., [AbsTopIII],
Propositions 2.5, 2.6].
Remark 3.1.3. Since Vbad
mod ̸= ∅[cf. Definition 3.1, (b)], it follows immediately
from Definition 3.1, (d), (e), (f), that the data (F/F, XF, l, CK, V, Vbad
mod, ϵ) is,
in fact, completely determined by the data (F/F, XF, CK, V, Vbad
mod), and that
CK is completely determined up to K-isomorphism by the data (F/F, XF, l, V).
Finally, we remark that for given data (XF, l, Vbad
mod), distinct choices of “V” will
not aﬀect the theory in any significant way.
Remark 3.1.4. It follows immediately from the definitions that at each v ∈Vbad
[which is necessarily prime to l — cf. Definition 3.1, (c)] (respectively, each v ∈
Vgood Vnon which is prime to l; each v ∈Vgood Vnon), X
v (respectively, X
− →v;
Xv) admits a stable model over the ring of integers of Kv.
Remark 3.1.5. Note that since the 3-torsion points of EF are rational over F,
and F is Galois over Fmod [cf. Definition 3.1, (b)], it follows [cf., e.g., [IUTchIV],
Proposition 1.8, (iv)] that K is Galois over Fmod. In addition to working with
the field Fmod and various extensions of Fmod contained in F, we shall also have
occasion to work with the algebraic stack
Smod
def = Spec(OK) // Gal(K/Fmod)
obtained by forming the stack-theoretic quotient [i.e., “//”] of the spectrum of the
ring of integers OK of K by the Galois group Gal(K/Fmod). Thus, any finite exten-
sionL ⊆F ofFmod inF determines, byformingtheintegralclosureofSmod inL, an
algebraic stack Smod,L over Smod. In particular, by considering arithmetic line bun-
dles over such Smod,L, one may associate to any finite quotient Gal(F/Fmod) Q
a Frobenioid via [the easily verified “stack-theoretic version” of] the construction
of [FrdI], Example 6.3. One verifies immediately that an appropriate analogue of
[FrdI], Theorem 6.4, holds for such stack-theoretic versions of the Frobenioids con-
structed in [FrdI], Example 6.3. Also, we observe that upon passing to either the
66 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
perfection or the realification, such stack-theoretic versions become naturally iso-
morphic to the non-stack-theoretic versions [i.e., of [FrdI], Example 6.3, as stated].
Remark 3.1.6. In light of the important role played by the various orbicurves
constructed in [EtTh], §2, in the present series of papers, we take the opportunity
to correct an unfortunate — albeit in fact irrelevant! — error in [EtTh]. In the
discussionpreceding[EtTh], Definition2.1, onemustinfactassumethattheinteger
l is odd in order for the quotient ΔX to be well-defined. Since, ultimately, in [EtTh]
[cf. the discussion following [EtTh], Remark 5.7.1], as well as in the present series
of papers, this is the only case that is of interest, this oversight does not aﬀect
either the present series of papers or the bulk of the remainder of [EtTh]. Indeed,
the only places in [EtTh] where the case of even l is used are [EtTh], Remark 2.2.1,
and the application of [EtTh], Remark 2.2.1, in the proof of [EtTh], Proposition
˙
2.12, for the orbicurves “
C”. Thus, [EtTh], Remark 2.2.1, must be deleted; in
[EtTh], Proposition 2.12, one must in fact exclude the case where the orbicurve
˙
under consideration is “
C”. On the other hand, this theory involving [EtTh],
Proposition 2.12 [cf., especially, [EtTh], Corollaries 2.18, 2.19] is only applied after
the discussion following [EtTh], Remark 5.7.1, i.e., which only treats the curves
“X”. That is to say, ultimately, in [EtTh], as well as in the present series of papers,
odd l.
one is only interested in the curves “X”, whose treatment only requires the case of
Remark 3.1.7.
(i) Observe that it follows immediately from the definition of Fmod and the K-
coricity of CK [cf. Definition 3.1, (b), (d)] that CF admits a unique [up to unique
isomorphism] model
CFmod
over Fmod. If v ∈Vmod, then we shall write Cv for the result of base-changing this
model to (Fmod)v. When applying the group-theoretic reconstruction algorithm
of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf. Remark 3.1.2, (ii)], it will frequently be useful to
considercertainspecial types of rational functions onCFmod andCv, asfollows.
Let L be a field which is equal either to Fmod or to (Fmod)v for some v ∈Vmod.
Write CL for the model just discussed of CF over L. Thus, one verifies immediately
that the coarse space |CL|associated to the algebraic stack CL is isomorphic to
the aﬃne line over L. Now suppose that we are given an algebraic closure LC
of the function field LC of CL. Write L for the algebraic closure of L determined
by LC. We shall refer to a closed point of the proper smooth curve determined
by some finite subextension ⊆LC of LC as a critical point if it maps to a closed
point of the [proper smooth] compactification |CL|cpt of |CL|that arises from one
of the 2-torsion points of EF; we shall refer to a critical point which does not
map to the closed point of |CL|cpt that arises from the unique cusp of CL as strictly
critical. Thus, as one might imagine from the central importance of 2-torsion points
in the elementary theory of elliptic curves, the strictly critical points of |CL|cpt may
be thought of as the “most fundamental/canonical non-cuspidal points” of
|CL|cpt. We shall refer to a rational function f ∈LC on CL as κ-coric — where we
think of the κ as standing for “Kummer” — if
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 67
· whenever f ̸∈ L, it holds that, over L, f has precisely one pole [of
unrestricted order], but at least two distinct zeroes;
· the divisor of zeroes and poles of f is defined over a number field and
avoids the critical points;
· f restricts to a root of unity at every strictly critical point of |CL|cpt
.
Thus, the first displayed condition, taken together with the latter portion of the
second displayed condition, may be understood as the condition that there exist
a unique non-critical L-rational point of |CL|cpt with respect to which [i.e., if one
takes this L-rational point to be the “point at infinity”] f may be thought of as a
polynomial on the aﬃne line over L with non-critical zeroes. In particular, it
follows from the first displayed condition that, whenever f ̸∈L, it is never the case
that both f and f−1 are κ-coric. By contrast, the third displayed condition may be
understood as the condition that restriction to the strictly critical points determines
a sort of canonical splitting up to roots of unity [which will play an important
role in the present series of papers — cf., e.g., the discussion of Example 5.1, (v);
Definition 5.2, (vi), (viii); Remark 5.2.3, below] of the set of nonzero constant [i.e.,
L-] multiples of κ-coric functions into a direct product, up to roots of unity, of
the set of κ-coric functions and the set of nonzero elements of L. In particular, it
follows from the third displayed condition that if c ∈L and f ∈LC are such that
both f and c·f are κ-coric, then c is a root of unity.
(ii) We maintain the notation of (i). Let L be an intermediate field between
L and L that is solvably closed [cf. [GlSol], Definition 1, (i)], i.e., has no nontrivial
abelian extensions. Observe that, since |CL|cpt has precisely 4 critical points, it
follows immediately from the elementary theory of polynomial functions on
the aﬃne line over L [i.e., the complement in |CL|cpt of some L-rational point
|CL|cpt] that there exists a κ-coric fsol ∈LC [i.e., a rational function on the aﬃne
line over L] of degree 4. In particular, it follows immediately from the elementary
theory of polynomial functions on the aﬃne line [i.e., |CL|] over L [together with
“Hensel’s lemma” — cf., e.g., the method of proof of [AbsTopII], Lemma 2.1]
(respectively, from the existence of fsol [together with the well-known fact that the
symmetric group on 4 letters is solvable]) that
every element of L (respectively, L ) appears as a value of some κ-coric
rational function on CL at some L- (respectively, L -) valued point of CL
that is not critical.
If L= Fmod, then write UL for the group L× of nonzero elements of L; if L=
(Fmod)v for some v ∈Vmod, then write UL for the group of units [i.e., relative
to the unique valuation on L that extends v] of L. We shall say that an element
f ∈LC is ∞κ-coric if there exists a positive integer n such that fn is a κ-coric
element of LC; we shall say that an element f ∈LC is ∞κ×-coric if there exists
an element c ∈UL such that c·f ∈LC is ∞κ-coric. Thus, an element f ∈LC is
κ-coric if and only if it is∞κ-coric. Also, one verifies immediately that
an ∞κ×-coric element f ∈LC is ∞κ-coric if and only if it restricts to a
root of unity at some [or, equivalently, every] strictly critical point of the
proper smooth curve determined by some finite subextension ⊆LC of the
function field LC that contains f.
subextension of K generated by the l-th roots of unity; LC(κ-sol) ⊆ LC for the
subfield of LC generated by the κ-solvable elements of LC; LC(CK) ⊆ LC for the
subfield of LC generated over LC by the images of the F(μl)·LC-linear embeddings
68 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
Finally, one verifies immediately that the operation of multiplication determines a
structure of pseudo-monoid [cf. §0] on the sets of κ-, ∞κ-, and∞κ×-coric rational
functions; moreover, in the case of∞κ- and ∞κ×-coric rational functions, the re-
sulting pseudo-monoid is divisible and cyclotomic. These pseudo-monoids will be
of use in discussions concerning the Kummer theory of rational functions on CL
[cf. Example 5.1, (i), (v); Definition 5.2, (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), below].
(iii)Wemaintainthenotationof(i)and(ii)andassumefurtherthatL= Fmod,
L= F. We shall say that an element f ∈LC is κ-solvable if it is an F×
sol-multiple
[cf. Definition 3.1, (b)] of a∞κ-coric element of LC. Thus, one verifies immediately
that an element f ∈LC is κ-solvable if and only if there exists a positive integer
n such that fn is a ∞κ×-coric element of Fsol·LC. Write F(μl) ⊆K for the
into LC of the function field of CK. Thus, the fact that the extension F/Fmod is
Galois of degree prime to l [cf. Definition 3.1, (b)] implies that
the subgroup Gal(K/F(μl)) ⊆Gal(K/Fmod) is normal and may be char-
acterized as the unique subgroup of Gal(K/Fmod) that is [abstractly]
isomorphic to SL2(Fl)
[cf. Remark 3.1.5; [GenEll], Lemma 3.1, (i)]. Moreover, we observe that it follows
immediately from the well-known fact that the finite group SL2(Fl) is perfect [cf.
Definition 3.1, (c); [GenEll], Lemma 3.1, (ii)], together with the definition of the
term“
∞κ×-coric”[cf., especially,thefactthatthezeroes and poles avoid the critical
points!], that
the subfields LC(CK) ⊆ LC ⊇ F(μl)·LC(κ-sol) are linearly disjoint
over F(μl)·LC.
In particular, it follows that there is a natural isomorphism
Gal(LC(CK)/F(μl)·LC)∼
→ Gal(LC(CK)·LC(κ-sol)/F(μl)·LC(κ-sol))
— i.e., one may regard Gal(LC(CK)/F(μl)·LC) as being equipped with an action
on LC(CK)·LC(κ-sol) that restricts to the trivial action on F(μl)·LC(κ-sol).

[cf. the discussion of (iii)]. Let us refer to a subgroup of Gal(LC/LC(κ-sol)) as
a κ-sol-open subgroup if it is the intersection with Gal(LC/LC(κ-sol)) of a normal
open subgroup of Gal(LC/LC). Thus, the subgroups
Autκ-sol(Gal(LC/LC(κ-sol))) ⊆ Aut(Gal(LC/LC(κ-sol)))

Finally, we observe that
Gal(LC/LC(κ-sol)) is center-free; in particular, the above commutative
diagram of homomorphisms of topological groups is cartesian.
Indeed, let us first observe that it follows immediately from the definitions that
Gal(F·LC(κ-sol)/F·LC) is abelian. Thus, it follows formally, by applying Lemma
2.7, (vi), (vii), to the geometric fundamental groups of the various genus zero aﬃne
hyperbolic curves whose function field is equal to LC, that the conjugacy action by
any element α in the center of Gal(LC/LC(κ-sol)) on such a [center-free] geometric
fundamental group is trivial and hence, by [the special case that was already known
to Belyi of] the Galois injectivity result discussed in [NodNon], Theorem C, that α
is the identity element of Gal(LC/LC(κ-sol)), as desired.
Given initial Θ-data as in Definition 3.1, the theory of Frobenioids given in
[FrdI], [FrdII], [EtTh] allows one to construct various associated Frobenioids, as
follows.
Example 3.2. Frobenioids at Bad Nonarchimedean Primes. Let v ∈
Vbad
= V V(K)bad. The theory of the “Frobenioid-theoretic theta function” dis-
cussed in [EtTh], §5, may be thought of as a sort of formal, category-theoretic way
to formulate various elementary classical facts [which are reviewed in [EtTh], §1]
concerning the theory of the line bundles and divisors related to the classical theta
function on a Tate curve over an MLF. We give a brief review of this theory of
[EtTh], §5, as follows:
(i) By the theory of [EtTh], the hyperbolic curve X
determines a tempered

[i.e., the category denoted “D” in the discussion at the beginning of [EtTh], §5].

of connected tempered coverings — i.e., “Btemp(X
v)0” in the notation of [EtTh],
Example 3.9 — of the hyperbolic curve X
v. In the following, we shall write
D⊢

def

[cf. the notational conventions concerning categories discussed in §0]. Also, we
observe that D⊢
v may be naturally regarded [by pulling back finite ´ etale coverings
via the structure morphism X

v
D⊢
v ⊆Dv
of Dv, and that we have a natural functor Dv → D⊢
v, which is left-adjoint to
the natural inclusion functor D⊢
v →Dv [cf. [FrdII], Example 1.3, (ii)]. If (−)
is an object of Dv, then we shall denote by “T(−)” the Frobenius-trivial object [a
notion which is category-theoretic — cf. [FrdI], Definition 1.2, (iv); [FrdI], Corollary
4.11, (iv); [EtTh], Proposition 5.1] of F

isomorphism] that lies over “(−)”.

“Frobenioid-theoretic l-th root of the theta function”, which is normalized so as to
attain the value 1 at the point “√−1” [cf. [EtTh], Theorem 5.7]; we shall denote
the reciprocal of [i.e., “1 over”] this theta function by

to a pair such as F⊢
v or FΘ
v consisting of a Frobenioid equipped with a collection
of characteristic splittings as a split Frobenioid.
(vi) Here, it is useful to recall [cf. Remark 3.2.1 below] that:
(a) the subcategory D⊢
v ⊆Dv may be reconstructed category-theoretically
from Dv [cf. [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.3.8];
(b) the category DΘ
v may be reconstructed category-theoretically from Dv [cf.
(a); the discussion at the beginning of [EtTh], §5];

from C⊢
v (respectively, CΘ

1.2, (i); [FrdII], Example 1.3, (i); [AbsAnab], Theorem 1.1.1, (ii)];
(d) the category Dv may be reconstructed category-theoretically either from
F
v [cf. [EtTh], Theorem 4.4; [EtTh], Proposition 5.1] or from Cv [cf.
[FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (v); [FrdII], Theorem 1.2, (i); [FrdII], Example 1.3,
(i); [SemiAnbd], Example 3.10; [SemiAnbd], Remark 3.4.1].
Next, let us observe that by (b), (d), together with the discussion of (ii) concerning
the category-theoreticity of Θ
v, it follows [cf. Remark 3.2.1 below] that
(e) one may reconstruct the split Frobenioid FΘ
v [up to the l·Z indeterminacy
in Θ
v discussed in (ii); cf. also Remark 3.2.3 below] category-theoretically
from F
v [cf. [FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (i), (v); [EtTh], Proposition 5.1].
Next, let us recall that the values of Θ
v may be computed by restricting the cor-
responding Kummer class, i.e., the“´ etale theta function” [cf. [EtTh], Proposition
1.4, (iii); the proof of [EtTh], Theorem 1.10, (ii); the proof of [EtTh], Theorem 5.7],
which may be reconstructed category-theoretically from Dv [cf. [EtTh], Corollary
2.8, (i)]. Thus, by applying the isomorphisms of cyclotomes of [AbsTopIII], Corol-
lary 1.10, (c); [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.2.1 [cf. also [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.1.1], to
these Kummer classes, one concludes from (a), (d) that
(f) one may reconstruct the split Frobenioid F⊢
v category-theoretically from
Cv, hence also [cf. (iii)] from F
v [cf. Remark 3.2.1 below].
Remark 3.2.1.
(i) In [FrdI], [FrdII], and [EtTh] [cf. [EtTh], Remark 5.1.1], the phrase “recon-
structed category-theoretically” is interpreted as meaning “preserved by equivalences
of categories”. From the point of view of the theory of [AbsTopIII] — i.e., the dis-
cussion of “mono-anabelian” versus “bi-anabelian” geometry [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I2,
74 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
(Q2)] — this sort of definition is “bi-anabelian” in nature. In fact, it is not diﬃcult
to verify that the techniques of [FrdI], [FrdII], and [EtTh] all result in explicit re-
construction algorithms, whose input data consists solely of the category structure
of the given category, of a “mono-anabelian” nature that do not require the use of
some fixed reference model that arises from scheme theory [cf. the discussion of
[AbsTopIII], §I4]. For more on the foundational aspects of such “mono-anabelian
reconstruction algorithms”, we refer to the discussion of [IUTchIV], Example 3.5.
(ii) One reason that we do not develop in detail here a “mono-anabelian ap-
proach to the geometry of categories” along the lines of [AbsTopIII] is that, unlike
the case with the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII], which plays a quite essen-
tial role in the theory of the present series of papers, much of the category-theoretic
reconstruction theory of [FrdI], [FrdII], and [EtTh] is not of essential importance
in the development of the theory of the present series of papers. That is to say, for
instance, instead of quoting results to the eﬀect that the base categories or divisor
monoids of various Frobenioids may be reconstructed category-theoretically, one
could instead simply work with the data consisting of “the category constituted by
the Frobenioid equipped with its pre-Frobenioid structure” [cf. [FrdI], Definition
1.1, (iv)]. Nevertheless, we chose to apply the theory of [FrdI], [FrdII], and [EtTh]
partly because it simplifies the exposition [i.e., reduces the number of auxiliary
structures that one must carry around], but more importantly because it renders
explicit precisely which structures arising from scheme-theory are “categorically
intrinsic” and which merely amount to “arbitrary, non-intrinsic choices” which,
when formulated intrinsically, correspond to various “indeterminacies”. This ex-
plicitness is of particular importance with respect to phenomena related to the unit-
linear Frobenius functor [cf. [FrdI], Proposition 2.5] and the Frobenioid-theoretic
indeterminacies studied in [EtTh], §5.
Remark 3.2.2. Although the submonoid ΦC⊢
v is not “absolutely primitive” in the
sense of [FrdII], Example 1.1, (ii), it is “very close to being absolutely primitive”,
in the sense that [as is easily verified] there exists a positive integer N such that
N·ΦC⊢
is absolutely primitive. This proximity to absolute primitiveness may also
v
be seen in the existence of the characteristic splittings τ⊢
v.

v of Example 3.2, (v), to B. Such pull-backs are useful, for
instance, when one considers the roots of Θ
v, as in the theory of [EtTh], §5.
Remark 3.2.4. Before proceeding, we pause to discuss certain minor oversights
on the part of the author in the discussion of the theory of tempered Frobenioids
in [EtTh], §3, §4. Let Zlog
∞ be as in the discussion at the beginning of [EtTh], §3.
Here, we recall that Zlog
∞ is obtained as the “universal combinatorial covering” of
the formal log scheme associated to a stable log curve with split special fiber over
the ring of integers of a finite extension of an MLF of residue characteristic p [cf.
loc. cit. for more details]; we write Zlog for the generic fiber of the stable log curve
under consideration.
(i) First, let us consider the following conditions on a nonzero meromorphic
function f on Zlog
∞ :
(a) For every N ∈N≥1, it holds that f admits an N-th root over some
tempered covering of Zlog
.
(b) For every N ∈N≥1 which is prime to p, it holds that f admits an N-th
root over some tempered covering of Zlog
.
(c) The divisor of zeroes and poles of f is a log-divisor.
It is immediate that (a) implies (b). Moreover, one verifies immediately, by consid-
ering the ramification divisors of the tempered coverings that arise from extracting
roots of f, that (b) implies (c). When N is prime to p, if f satisfies (c), then
it follows immediately from the theory of admissible coverings [cf., e.g., [PrfGC],
§2, §8] that there exists a finite log ´ etale covering Ylog →Zlog whose pull-back
Ylog
∞ →Zlog
∞ to the generic fiber Zlog
∞ of Zlog
∞ is suﬃcient
(R1) to annihilate all ramification over the cusps or special fiber of Zlog
∞ that
might arise from extracting an N-th root of f, as well as
76 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
(R2) to split all extensions of the function fields of irreducible components of
the special fiber of Zlog
∞ that might arise from extracting an N-th root of
f.
That is to say, in this situation, it follows that f admits an N-th root over the
tempered covering of Zlog given by the “universal combinatorial covering” of Ylog
.
In particular, it follows that (c) implies (b). Thus, in summary, we have:
(a) =⇒ (b) ⇐⇒ (c).
On the other hand, unfortunately, it is not clear to the author at the time of writing
whether or not (c) [or (b)] implies (a).
(ii) Observe that it follows from the theory of [EtTh], §1 [cf., especially, [EtTh],
Proposition 1.3] that the theta function that forms the main topic of interest of
[EtTh] satisfies condition (a) of (i).
(iii) In [EtTh], Definition 3.1, (ii), a meromorphic function f as in (i) is defined
to be “log-meromorphic” if it satisfies condition (c) of (i). On the other hand, in the
proof of [EtTh], Proposition 4.2, (iii), it is necessary to use property (a) of (i) —
i.e., despite the fact that, as remarked in (i), it is not clear whether or not property
(c) implies property (a). The author apologizes for any confusion caused by this
oversight on his part.
(iv) The problem pointed out in (iii) may be remedied — at least from the
point of view of the theory of [EtTh] — via either of the following two approaches:
(A) One may modify [EtTh], Definition 3.1, (ii), by taking the definition of a
“log-meromorphic” function to be a function that satisfies condition (a) [i.e., as
opposed to condition (c)] of (i). [In light of the content of this modified definition,
perhaps a better term for this class of meromorphic functions would be “tempered-
meromorphic”.] Then the remainder of the text of [EtTh] goes through without
change.
(B) One may modify [EtTh], Definition 4.1, (i), by assuming that the meromorphic
function “f ∈ O×(Abirat)” of [EtTh], Definition 4.1, (i), satisfies the following
“Frobenioid-theoretic version” of condition (a):
(d) For every N ∈N≥1, there exists a linear morphism A′ →A in Csuch
that the pull-back of f to A′ admits an N-th root.
[Here, we recall that, as discussed in (ii), the Frobenioid-theoretic theta functions
that appear in [EtTh] satisfy (d).] Note that since the rational function monoid of
the Frobenioid C, as well as the linear morphisms of C, are category-theoretic [cf.
[FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (iii), (v); [FrdI], Corollary 4.10], this condition (d) is category-
theoretic. Thus, if one modifies [EtTh], Definition 4.1, (i), in this way, then the
remainder of the text of [EtTh] goes through without change, except that one must
replace the reference to the definition of “log-meromorphic” [i.e., [EtTh], Definition
3.1, (ii)] that occurs in the proof of [EtTh], Proposition 4.2, (iii), by a reference to
condition (d) [i.e., in the modified version of [EtTh], Definition 4.1, (i)].
(v) In the discussion of (iv), we note that the approach of (A) results in a
slightlydiﬀerentdefinitionofthenotionofa“tempered Frobenioid”fromtheoriginal
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 77
definition given in [EtTh]. Put another way, the approach of (B) has the advantage
that it does not result in any modification of the definition of the notion of a
“tempered Frobenioid”; that is to say, the approach of (B) only results in a slight
reductionintherangeofapplicabilityofthetheoryof[EtTh],§4,whichisessentially
irrelevant from the point of view of the present series of papers, since [cf. (ii)] theta
functions lie within this reduced range of applicability. On the other hand, the
approach of (A) has the advantage that one may consider the Kummer theory
of arbitrary rational functions of the tempered Frobenioid without imposing any
further hypotheses. Thus, for the sake of simplicity, in the present series of papers,
we shall interpret the notion of a “tempered Frobenioid” via the approach of (A).
(vi) Strictly speaking, the definition of the monoid “Φell
W” given in [EtTh],
Example 3.9, (iii), leads to certain technical diﬃculties, which are, in fact, entirely
irrelevant to the theory of [EtTh]. These technical diﬃculties may be averted by
making the following slight modifications to the text of [EtTh], Example 3.9, as
follows:
(1) In the discussion following the first display of [EtTh], Example 3.9, (i),
the phrase “Ylog is of genus 1” should be replaced by the phrase “Ylog is
of genus 1 and has either precisely one cusp or precisely two cusps whose
diﬀerence is a 2-torsion element of the underlying elliptic curve”.
(2) In the discussion following the first display of [EtTh], Example 3.9, (i),
the phrase
˙
the lower arrow of the diagram to be “
Xlog
→˙
Clog”
should be replaced by the phrase
˙
the lower arrow of the diagram to be “
Xlog →˙
Clog”.
(3) In the discussion following the first display of [EtTh], Example 3.9, (ii),
the phrase “unramified over the cusps of ...” should be replaced by the
phrase “unramified over the cusps as well as over the generic points of the
irreducible components of the special fibers of the stable models of ...”.
Also, the phrase “tempered coverings of the underlying ...” should be
replaced by the phrase “tempered admissible coverings of the underlying
...”.
In a word, the thrust of both the original text and the slight modifications just
discussed is that the monoid “Φell
W” is to be defined to be just large enough to
include precisely those divisors which are necessary in order to treat the theta
functions that appear in [EtTh].

Finally, by applying the algorithmically constructed field structure on the image

category determined by Spec(Kv). Thus, the linear morphisms among the pseudo-
terminal objects of C determine unique isomorphisms [cf. [FrdI], Definition 1.3,
(iii), (c)] among the respective topological monoids“O◃(−)” — where we recall
[cf. [FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (iii); [FrdII], Theorem 3.6, (i), (vii)] that these topological
monoids may be reconstructed category-theoretically from C. In particular, it makes
sense to write “O◃(Cv)”, “O×(Cv) ⊆O◃(Cv)”. Moreover, we observe that, by
construction, there is a natural isomorphism
O◃(Cv)∼ →O◃

representation” of the topological monoid O◃

(iii) Next, let us observe that pv ∈Kv [cf. §0] may be thought of as a(n) [non-
identity] element of the noncompact factor ΦC⊢
v [i.e., the factor denoted by a “→” in
the definition of TM⊢] of the object (O◃(C⊢

ΦC⊢
v is isomorphic, as a topological monoid, to R≥0; let us write ΦC⊢
v additively
and denote by log(pv) the element of ΦC⊢
v determined by pv. Thus, relative to
the natural action [by multiplication!] of R≥0 on ΦC⊢
v , it follows that log(pv) is a
generator of ΦC⊢

Remark 3.4.1. A similar remark to Remark 3.2.1 [i.e., concerning the phrase
“reconstructed category-theoretically”] applies to the phrase “algorithmically recon-
structed” that was applied in the discussion of Example 3.4.
Remark 3.4.2. discussed in Example 3.4, (i), is as follows. In the terminology of [AbsTopIII], Def-
inition 2.1, (i), (iv), the structure of CAF on ADv determines, via pull-back by κv,
an Aut-holomorphic structure on the groupification O◃(Cv)gp of O◃(Cv), together
with a [tautological!] co-holomorphicization O◃(Cv)gp →ADv. Conversely, if one
starts with this Aut-holomorphic structure on [the groupification of] the topological
monoid O◃(Cv), together with the co-holomorphicization O◃(Cv)gp →ADv, then
One way to think of the Kummer structure
κv : O◃(Cv) →ADv
one verifies immediately that one may recover the inclusion of topological monoids
κv. [Indeed, this follows immediately from [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.3, together
with the elementary fact that every holomorphic automorphism of the complex Lie
group C× that preserves the submonoid of elements of norm ≤1 is equal to the
identity.] That is to say, in summary,
the Kummer structure κv is completely equivalent to the collection
of data consisting of the Aut-holomorphic structure [induced by κv] on
thegroupificationO◃(Cv)gp ofO◃(Cv),togetherwiththeco-holomorphi-
cization [induced by κv] O◃(Cv)gp →ADv
.
ThesignificanceofthinkingofKummerstructuresinthiswayliesintheobservation
that [unlike inclusions of topological monoids!]
the co-holomorphicization induced by κv is compatible with the log-
arithm operation discussed in [AbsTopIII], Corollary 4.5.
Indeed, this observation may be thought of as a rough summary of a substantial
portion of the content of [AbsTopIII], Corollary 4.5. Put another way, thinking of
Kummer structures in terms of co-holomorphicizations allows one to separate out
the portion of the structures involved that is not compatible with this logarithm
operation — i.e., the monoid structures! — from the portion of the structures
involved that is compatible with this logarithm operation — i.e., the tautological
co-holomorphicization.

Remark 3.4.3.
(i) In the notation of Example 3.4, write A× ⊆A for the topological group
of units [i.e., of elements of norm 1] of the CAF A [so A× is noncanonically iso-
morphic to the unit circle S1]; Aμ ⊆A× for the subgroup of torsion elements
[so Aμ is noncanonically isomorphic to Q/Z]; Ev for the Aut-holomorphic space
[cf. [AbsTopIII], Definition 2.1, (i)] determined by the elliptic curve obtained by
compactifying XK at v. Now recall from the construction of “A ” in [AbsTopIII],
Corollary 2.7 [cf. also [AbsTopIII], Definition 4.1, (i)] via the technique of “holo-
morphic elliptic cuspidalization”, thatonehasanatural isomorphism of CAF’s
AX
− →v
∼

— which may be used to “identify” AX

with AX
− →v
v. Indeed, thinking of
“AX
= ADv
” as “AX
− →v
v” is natural from the point of view of the“Θ-approach”
discussed in Remark 3.1.2, (ii). Moreover, by allowing A×
X
to “act” [cf. the algo-
v
rithm discussed in [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.7, (e)] on points in a suﬃciently small
neighborhood of [but not equal to!] a given point “x” of Ev, one may regard the
“circle” A×
X
as a deformation retract of the complement of x in a suitable small
v
neighborhood of x in Ev. In particular,
from the point of view of the“Θ-approach” discussed in Remark 3.1.2,
(ii), it is natural to think of “AX
” as “AX
− →v
v” and to regard
Hom(Q/Z,Aμ
X
) = Hom(Q/Z,A×
X
v
v
[a profinite group which is noncanonically isomorphic to Z] as the result
of identifying the cuspidal inertia groups of the various points “x” of

— cf. discussion of the cuspidal inertia groups “Ix” in [AbsTopIII], Proposition
1.4, (i), (ii). Indeed, this interpretation of AX
= ADv via cuspidal inertia groups
− →v
may be thought of as a sort of archimedean version of the “Θ-approach” discussed
in Remark 3.1.2, (ii).
(ii)Weobservethatjustasthetheoryofelliptic cuspidalization[cf. [AbsTopII],
Example 3.2; [AbsTopII], Corollaries 3.3, 3.4] admits a straightforward holomorphic
analogue, i.e., the theory of “holomorphic elliptic cuspidalization” [cf. [AbsTopIII],
Corollary2.7]referredtoin(i)above,thetheoryofBelyi cuspidalization[cf. [Ab-

admits a straightforward holomorphic analogue, i.e., a theory of “holomorphic
Belyi cuspidalization”. We leave the routine details to the reader. Here, we ob-
serve that one immediate consequence of such “holomorphic Belyi cuspidalizations”
may be stated as follows:
the set of NF-points [i.e., points defined over a number field] of the
underlying topological space of the Aut-holomorphic space Dv may be
reconstructed via a functorial algorithm from the [abstract] Aut-
holomorphic space Dv.

6.3 [cf. also Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper], associated to the number field Fmod
and the trivial Galois extension [i.e., the Galois extension of degree 1] of Fmod [so
the base category of Cmod is, in the terminology of [FrdI], equivalent to a one-
morphism category]. Thus, the divisor monoid ΦCmod
of Cmod may be thought of
as a single abstract monoid, whose set of primes, which we denote Prime(Cmod)
[cf. [FrdI], §0], is in natural bijective correspondence with Vmod [cf. the discussion
of [FrdI], Example 6.3]. Moreover, the submonoid ΦCmod,v of ΦCmod corresponding

(Fmod)v)pf ⊗R≥0 (∼

ord(O◃

Then observe that regardless of whether v belongs to Vbad

the realification Φrlf

of the divisor monoid ΦC⊢
of C⊢

for the natural restriction functor [cf. the theory of poly-Frobenioids developed in
[FrdII], §5] to the realification of the Frobenioid C⊢
v [cf. [FrdI], Proposition 5.3].

isomorphism of topological monoids [which are isomorphic to R≥0]

This fact may be expressed as a natural isomorphism between collections of data

a collection of isomorphisms indexed by V]

(iii) One may also construct a“D-version” — which, from the point of view of
the theory of [AbsTopIII], one may also think of as a “log-shell version” — of the
various data constructed in (i), (ii). To this end, we write
Dmod

that map to the corresponding objects associated to Cmod under the tautological
equivalence of categories Cmod

corresponds to v. Next, suppose that v ∈Vnon; then let us recall from [AbsTopIII],
Proposition 5.8, (iii), that [since the profinite group associated to D⊢
v is the absolute
Galois group of an MLF] one may construct algorithmically from D⊢
v a topological
monoid isomorphic to R≥0

[i.e., the topological monoid determined by the nonnegative elements of the ordered
topological group “Rnon(G)” of loc. cit.] equipped with a distinguished “Frobenius
element” ∈(R⊢
≥0)v; if ev is the absolute ramification index of the MLF Kv, then we
shall write logD
Φ(pv) ∈(R⊢

by [the positive real number] ev. Next, suppose that v ∈Varc; then let us recall
from [AbsTopIII], Proposition 5.8, (vi), that [since, by definition, D⊢
v ∈Ob(TM⊢)]
one may construct algorithmically from D⊢
v a topological monoid isomorphic to R≥0

[i.e., the topological monoid determined by the nonnegative elements of the ordered

Φ(pv) ∈(R⊢

Frobenius element by [the positive real number] 2π. In particular, for every v ∈V,
we obtain a uniquely determined isomorphism of topological monoids [which are

Remark 3.5.2. ventions.
In Example 3.5, as well as in the following discussion, we shall
often speak of “isomorphisms of collections of data”, relative to the following con-
(i) Such isomorphisms are always assumed to satisfy various evident compati-
bility conditions, relative to the various relationships stipulated between the various
constituent data, whose explicit mention we shall omit for the sake of simplicity.
(ii) In situations where the collections of data consist partially of various cat-
egories, the portion of the “isomorphism of collections of data” involving corre-
sponding categories is to be understood as an isomorphism class of equivalences of
categories [cf. §0].
Definition 3.6. Fixacollectionofinitial Θ-data(F/F, XF, l, CK, V, Vbad

as in Definition 3.1. In the following, we shall use the various notations introduced
inDefinition3.1forvariousobjectsassociatedtothisinitialΘ-data. Thenwedefine
a Θ-Hodge theater [relative to the given initial Θ-data] to be a collection of data
†HTΘ = ({†F

Remark 3.6.1. When we discuss various collections of Θ-Hodge theaters, labeled
by some symbol “ ” in place of a “†”, we shall apply the notation of Definition 3.6
with “†” replaced by “ ” to denote the various objects associated to the Θ-Hodge
theater labeled by “ ”.
Remark 3.6.2. If †HTΘ and ‡HTΘ are Θ-Hodge theaters, then there is an
evident notion of isomorphism of Θ-Hodge theaters †HTΘ∼

3.5.2]. We leave the routine details to the interested reader.

Proof. The various assertions of Corollary 3.7 follow immediately from the defini-
tions and the discussion of Examples 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5. ⃝
Remark 3.7.1. One verifies immediately that there exist many distinct isomor-
phisms †Ftht
∼
→‡Fmod as in Corollary 3.7, (i), none of which is conferred a “dis-
tinguished” status, i.e., in the fashion of the “natural isomorphism Fmod

”
discussed in Example 3.5, (ii).
The following result follows formally from Corollary 3.7.
Corollary 3.8. (Frobenius-pictures of Θ-Hodge Theaters) Fix a collection
of initial Θ-data as in Corollary 3.7. Let {nHTΘ}n∈Z be a collection of distinct
Θ-Hodge theaters indexed by the integers. Then by applying Corollary 3.7, (i),
with †HTΘ def
= nHTΘ
,
‡HTΘ def
= (n+1)HTΘ, we obtain an infinite chain
Θ
...
−→ (n−1)HTΘ Θ
−→ nHTΘ Θ
−→ (n+1)HTΘ Θ
−→...
of Θ-linked Θ-Hodge theaters. This infinite chain may be represented symboli-
cally as an oriented graph⃗
Γ [cf. [AbsTopIII], §0]
... → • → • → • →...
— i.e., where the arrows correspond to the “ Θ
−→’s”, and the “•’s” correspond to the
“nHTΘ”. This oriented graph⃗
Γ admits a natural action by Z — i.e., a translation
symmetry — but it does not admit arbitrary permutation symmetries. For
instance,⃗
Γ does not admit an automorphism that switches two adjacent vertices,
but leaves the remaining vertices fixed. Put another way, from the point of view of
the discussion of [FrdI], §I4, the mathematical structure constituted by this infinite
chain is “Frobenius-like”, or “order-conscious”. It is for this reason that
we shall refer to this infinite chain in the following discussion as the Frobenius-
picture.
90 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
Remark 3.8.1.

the Θ-link maps

[i.e., where v ∈Vbad — cf. the discussion of Example 3.2, (v)]. From this point of
view, the Frobenius-picture may be depicted as in Fig. 3.1 below — i.e., each box

that lies between “q

Fig. 3.1: Frobenius-picture of Θ-Hodge theaters
(ii) It is perhaps not surprising [cf. the theory of [FrdI]] that the Frobenius-
picture involves, in an essential way, the divisor monoid portion [i.e., “q
” and
v
“Θ
v”] of the various Frobenioids that appear in a Θ-Hodge theater. Put another
way,
it is as if the “Frobenius-like nature” of the divisor monoid portion of the
Frobenioids involved induces the “Frobenius-like nature” of the Frobenius-
picture.
By contrast, observe that for v ∈V, the isomorphisms
...
∼

v

→ (n+1)D⊢
v

of Corollary 3.7, (ii), imply that if one thinks of the various (−)D⊢
v as being only
known up to isomorphism, then
one may regard (−)D⊢
v as a sort of constant invariant of the various
Θ-Hodge theaters that constitute the Frobenius-picture
— cf. Remark 3.9.1 below. This observation is the starting point of the theory of
the´ etale-picture [cf. Corollary 3.9, (i), below]. Note that by Corollary 3.7, (iii), we
also obtain isomorphisms
...

nC⊢

lying over the isomorphisms involving the “(−)D⊢
v” discussed above.
(iii) In the situation of (ii), suppose that v ∈Vnon. Then (−)D⊢
v is simply
the category of connected objects of the Galois category associated to the profinite
group Gv. That is to say, one may think of (−)D⊢
v as representing“Gv up to

isomorphism”. Then each nDv represents an “isomorph of the topological group
Πv, labeled by n, which is regarded as an extension of some isomorph of Gv that
is independent of n”. In particular, the quotients corresponding to Gv of the
copies of Πv that arise from nHTΘ for diﬀerent n are only related to one another
via some indeterminate isomorphism. Thus, from the point of view of the theory of
[AbsTopIII] [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I3; [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.2, (ii)], each Πv gives
rise to a well-defined ring structure — i.e., a “holomorphic structure” — which is
obliterated by the indeterminate isomorphism between the quotient isomorphs of
Gv arising fromnHTΘ for distinct n.
(iv) In the situation of (ii), suppose that v ∈Varc. Then (−)D⊢
v is an object
of TM⊢; eachnDv represents an “isomorph of the Aut-holomorphic orbispace X
− →v,
labeled by n, whose associated [complex archimedean] topological field AX
gives
− →v
rise to an isomorph of D⊢
v that is independent of n”. In particular, the various
isomorphs of D⊢
v associated to the copies of X
that arise from nHTΘ for diﬀerent
− →v
n are only related to one another via some indeterminate isomorphism. Thus, from
the point of view of the theory of [AbsTopIII] [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I3; [AbsTopIII],
Remark 5.10.2, (ii)], each X
− →v gives rise to a well-defined ring structure — i.e., a
“holomorphic structure” — which is obliterated by the indeterminate isomorphism
between the isomorphs of D⊢
v arising fromnHTΘ for distinct n.
The discussion of Remark 3.8.1, (iii), (iv), may be summarized as follows.

(i) We have a diagram as in Fig. 3.2 above, which we refer to as the´ etale-
picture. Here, each horizontal and vertical “— —” denotes the relationship be-
tween (−)Dv and D⊢
v — i.e., an extension of topological groups when v ∈Vnon
,
or the underlying object of TM⊢ arising from the associated topological field when
v ∈Varc — discussed in Remark 3.8.1, (iii), (iv). The ´ etale-picture [unlike the
Frobenius-picture!] admits arbitrary permutation symmetries among the la-
bels n ∈Z corresponding to the various Θ-Hodge theaters. Put another way, the
´ etale-picture may be thought of as a sort of canonical splitting of the Frobenius-
picture.
(ii) In a similar vein, we have a diagram as in Fig. 3.3 above, obtained
by replacing the “D⊢
v” in the middle of Fig. 3.2 by “D⊢
v O×
C⊢
”. Here, each
v
horizontal and vertical “— —” denotes the relationship between (−)Dv and D⊢
v
discussed in (i); when v ∈Vnon, the notation “D⊢
v O×
C⊢
” denotes an isomorph
v
of the pair consisting of the category D⊢
v together with the group-like monoid O×
C⊢
v
on D⊢
v; when v ∈Varc, the notation “D⊢
v O×
C⊢
” denotes an isomorph of the
v
pair consisting of the object D⊢
v ∈Ob(TM⊢) and the topological group O×
C⊢
[which
v
is isomorphic — but not canonically! — to the compact factor of D⊢
v]. Just as in
the case of (i), this diagram admits arbitrary permutation symmetries among
the labels n ∈Z corresponding to the various Θ-Hodge theaters.
Remark 3.9.1. If one formulates things relative to the language of [AbsTopIII],
Definition3.5, then(−)D⊢
v constitutesacore. Relativetothetheoryof[AbsTopIII],
§5, this core is essentially the mono-analytic core discussed in [AbsTopIII], §I3;
[AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.2, (ii). Indeed, the symbol “⊢” is intended — both in
[AbsTopIII] and in the present series of papers! — as an abbreviation for the term
“mono-analytic”.

Remark 3.9.2. Whereas the´ etale-picture of Corollary 3.9, (i), will remain valid
throughout the development of the remainder of the theory of the present series of
papers, the local units “O×
C⊢
” that appear in Corollary 3.9, (ii), will ultimately cease
v
to be a constant invariantofvariousenhancedversionsoftheFrobenius-picturethat
will arise in the theory of [IUTchIII]. In a word, these enhancements revolve around
the incorporation into each Hodge theater of the “rotation of addition [i.e., ‘ ’]
and multiplication [i.e., ‘ ’]” in the style of the theory of [AbsTopIII].
Remark 3.9.3.
(i) As discussed in [AbsTopIII], §I3; [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.2, (ii), the
“mono-analytic core” {D⊢
v}v∈V may be thought of as a sort of fixed underly-
ing real-analytic surface associated to a number field on which various holo-
morphic structures are imposed. Then the Frobenius-picture in its entirety may
be thought of as a sort of global arithmetic analogue of the notion of a Te-
ichm¨ uller geodesic in classical complex Teichm¨ uller theory or, alternatively, as a
global arithmetic analogue of the canonical liftings of p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory
[cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I5].
(ii) Recall that in classical complex Teichm¨ uller theory, one of the two real di-
mensions of the surface is dilated as one moves along a Teichm¨ uller geodesic, while
the other of the two real dimensions is held fixed. In the case of the Frobenius-
picture of Corollary 3.8, the local units “O×” correspond to the dimension that
is held fixed, while the local value groups are subject to“Θ-dilations” as one
moves along the diagram constituted by the Frobenius-picture. Note that in order
to construct such a mathematical structure in which the local units and local value
groups are treated independently, it is of crucial importance to avail oneself of
the various characteristic splittings that appear in the split Frobenioids of Ex-
amples 3.2, 3.3, 3.4. Here, we note in passing that, in the case of Example 3.2,
this splitting corresponds to the “constant multiple rigidity” of the ´ etale theta
function, which forms a central theme of the theory of [EtTh].
(iii) In classical complex Teichm¨ uller theory, the two real dimensions of the
surface that are treated independently of one another correspond to the real and
imaginary parts of the coordinate obtained by locally integrating the square root
of a given square diﬀerential. In particular, it is of crucial importance in classical
complex Teichm¨ uller theory that these real and imaginary parts not be “subject to
confusion with one another”. In the case of the square root of a square diﬀerential,
the only indeterminacy that arises is indeterminacy with respect to multiplication
by−1, an operation that satisfies the crucial property of preserving the real and
imaginary parts of a complex number. By contrast, it is interesting to note that
if, for n ≥3, one attempts to construct Teichm¨ uller deformations in the
fashion of classical complex Teichm¨ uller theory by means of coordinates
obtained by locally integrating the n-th root of a given section of the n-
th tensor power of the sheaf of diﬀerentials, then one must contend with
an indeterminacy with respect to multiplication by an n-th root of unity,
an operation that results in an essential confusion between the real and
imaginary parts of a complex number.
94 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
⃗
(iv) Whereas linear movement along the oriented graph
Γ of Corollary 3.8 cor-
responds to the linear flow along a Teichm¨ uller geodesic, the “rotation of addition
[i.e., ‘ ’] and multiplication [i.e., ‘ ’]” in the style of the theory of [AbsTopIII]
— which will be incorporated into the theory of the present series of papers in
[IUTchIII] [cf. Remark 3.9.2] — corresponds to rotations around a fixed point in
the complex geometry arising from Teichm¨ uller theory [cf., e.g., the discussion of
[AbsTopIII], §I3; the hyperbolic geometry of the upper half-plane, regarded as the
“Teichm¨ uller space” of compact Riemann surfaces of genus 1]. Alternatively, in the
analogy with p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory, this “rotation of and ” corresponds
to the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic — cf. the discussion of [Ab-
sTopIII], §I5.
Remark 3.9.4. At first glance, the assignment “nΘ
v
→(n+1)q
” [cf. Remark
v
3.8.1, (i)] may strike the reader as being nothing more than a “conventional eval-
uation map” [i.e., of the theta function at a torsion point — cf. the discussion of
Example 3.2, (iv)]. Although we shall ultimately be interested, in the theory of the
present series of papers, in such “Hodge-Arakelov-style evaluation maps” [within
a fixed Hodge theater!] of the theta function at torsion points [cf. the theory of
[IUTchII]], the Θ-link considered here diﬀers quite fundamentally from such con-
ventional evaluation maps in the following respect:
the value (n+1)q
belongs to a distinct scheme theory — i.e., the
v
scheme theory represented by the distinct Θ-Hodge theater (n+1)HTΘ
—
from the base nq
[which belongs to the scheme theory represented by the
v
Θ-Hodge theaternHTΘ] over which the theta functionnΘ
is constructed.
v
The distinctness of the ring/scheme theories of distinct Θ-Hodge theaters may be
seen, for instance, in the indeterminacy of the isomorphism between the associated
isomorphs of D⊢
v, an indeterminacy which has the eﬀect of obliterating the ring
structure — i.e., the “arithmetic holomorphic structure” — associated to nDv for
distinct n [cf. the discussion of Remark 3.8.1, (iii), (iv)].

ULLER THEORY I 95
Section 4: Multiplicative Combinatorial Teichm¨ uller Theory
In the present §4, we begin to prepare for the construction of the various
“enhancements” to the Θ-Hodge theaters of §3 that will be made in §5. More
precisely, in the present §4, we discuss the combinatorial aspects of the “D” — i.e.,
intheterminologyofthetheoryofFrobenioids, the“base category”—portionofthe
notions to be introduced in §5 below. In a word, these combinatorial aspects revolve
around the “functorial dynamics” imposed upon the various number fields and
local fields involved by the “labels”
∈ Fl
def
= F×
l /{±1}
— where we note that the set Fl is of cardinality l def = (l−1)/2 — of the l-torsion
points at which we intend to conduct, in [IUTchII], the “Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation” of the ´ etale theta function studied in [EtTh] [cf. Remarks 4.3.1; 4.3.2;
4.5.1, (v); 4.9.1, (i)].
In the following, we fix a collection of initial Θ-data
(F/F, XF, l, CK, V, Vbad
mod, ϵ)
as in Definition 3.1; also, we shall use the various notations introduced in Definition
3.1 for various objects associated to this initial Θ-data.
Definition 4.1.
(i) We define a holomorphic base-prime-strip, or D-prime-strip, [relative to the
given initial Θ-data] to be a collection of data
†D= {†Dv}v∈V
that satisfies the following conditions: (a) if v ∈Vnon, then †Dv is a category which
admits an equivalence of categories †Dv
∼ →Dv [where Dv is as in Examples 3.2, (i);
3.3, (i)]; (b) if v ∈Varc, then †Dv is an Aut-holomorphic orbispace such that there
exists an isomorphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces †Dv
∼ →Dv [where Dv is as in
Example3.4, (i)]. Observethatifv ∈Vnon, thenπ1(†Dv)determines, inafunctorial
fashion, a topological [in fact, profinite if v ∈Vgood] group corresponding to “Cv
”
[cf. Corollary 1.2 if v ∈Vgood; [EtTh], Proposition 2.4, if v ∈Vbad], which contains
π1(†Dv) as an open subgroup; thus, if we write †Dv for B(−)0 of this topological
group, then we obtain a natural morphism †Dv →†Dv [cf. §0]. In a similar vein, if
v ∈Varc, then since X
− →v
admits a Kv-core, a routine translation into the “language
of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces” of the argument given in the proof of Corollary 1.2
[cf. also [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.4] reveals that †Dv determines, in a functorial
fashion, an Aut-holomorphic orbispace †Dv corresponding to “Cv”, together with
a natural morphism †Dv →†Dv of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces. Thus, in summary,
one obtains a collection of data
†D= {†Dv}v∈V
96 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
completely determined by †D.
(ii) Suppose that we are in the situation of (i). Then observe that by applying
the group-theoretic algorithm of [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5 [cf., especially, [AbsTopI],
Lemma 4.5, (v), as well as Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper], to construct
the set of conjugacy classes of cuspidal decomposition groups of the topological
group π1(†Dv) when v ∈Vnon, or by considering π0(−) of a cofinal collection of
“neighborhoods of infinity” [i.e., complements of compact subsets] of the underlying
topological space of †Dv when v ∈Varc, it makes sense to speak of the set of cusps
of †Dv; a similar observation applies to †Dv, for v ∈V. If v ∈V, then we define
a label class of cusps of †Dv to be the set of cusps of †Dv that lie over a single
LabCusp(†Dv)
“nonzero cusp” [i.e., a cusp that arises from a nonzero element of the quotient “Q”
that appears in the definition of a “hyperbolic orbicurve of type (1,l-tors)±” given
in [EtTh], Definition 2.1] of †Dv; write
for the set of label classes of cusps of †Dv. Thus, for each v ∈V, LabCusp(†Dv)
admits a natural Fl -torsor structure [i.e., which arises from the natural action of
F×
l on the quotient “Q” of [EtTh], Definition 2.1]. Moreover, [for any v ∈V!] one
may construct, solely from †Dv, a canonical element
∈LabCusp(†Dv)
†ηv
determined by “ϵv” [cf. the notation of Definition 3.1, (f)]. [Indeed, this follows
from [EtTh], Corollary 2.9, for v ∈Vbad, from Corollary 1.2 for v ∈Vgood Vnon
,
andfromtheevidenttranslationintothe“languageofAut-holomorphicorbispaces”
of Corollary 1.2 for v ∈Varc.]
(iii) We define a mono-analytic base-prime-strip, or D⊢-prime-strip, [relative
to the given initial Θ-data] to be a collection of data
†D⊢
= {†D⊢

that satisfies the following conditions: (a) if v ∈Vnon, then †D⊢

(iv) A morphism of D- (respectively, D⊢-) prime-strips is defined to be a col-
lection of morphisms, indexed by V, between the various constituent objects of the
prime-strips. Following the conventions of §0, one thus has a notion of capsules of
D- (respectively, D⊢-) and morphisms of capsules of D- (respectively, D⊢-) prime-
strips. Note that to any D-prime-strip †D, one may associate, in a natural way,
a D⊢-prime-strip †D⊢ — which we shall refer to as the mono-analyticization of
†D — by considering appropriate subcategories at the nonarchimedean primes [cf.
Examples 3.2, (i), (vi); 3.3, (i), (iii)], or by applying the construction of Example
3.4, (ii), at the archimedean primes.

(v) Write
D def
= B(CK)0
[cf. §0]. Then recall from [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf. Remark 3.1.2], that
there exists a group-theoretic algorithm for reconstructing, from π1(D ) [cf. §0],
the algebraic closure “F” of the base field “K”, hence also the set of valuations
“V(F)” [e.g., as a collection of topologies on F — cf., e.g., [AbsTopIII], Corollary
2.8]. Moreover, for w ∈ V(K)arc, let us recall [cf. Remark 3.1.2; [AbsTopIII],
Corollaries 2.8, 2.9] that one may reconstruct group-theoretically, from π1(D ), the
Aut-holomorphic orbispace Cw associated to Cw. Let †D be a category equivalent
to D . Then let us write
V(†D )
for the set of valuations [i.e., “V(F)”], equipped with its natural π1(†D )-action,
V(†D ) def
= V(†D )/π1(†D )
for the quotient of V(†D ) by π1(†D ) [i.e., “V(K)”], and, for w ∈V(†D )arc
,
C(†D ,w)
[i.e., “Cw” — cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], Definition 5.1, (ii)] for the Aut-
holomorphic orbispace obtained by applying these group-theoretic reconstruction
algorithms to π1(†D ). Now if U is an arbitrary Aut-holomorphic orbispace, then
let us define a morphism
U →†D
to be a morphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces [cf. [AbsTopIII], Definition 2.1,
(ii)] U →C(†D ,w) for some w ∈V(†D )arc. Thus, it makes sense to speak of the
pre-composite (respectively, post-composite) of such a morphism U →†D with
a morphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces (respectively, with an isomorphism [cf.
§0] †D∼
→‡D [i.e., where ‡D is a category equivalent to D ]). Finally, just as in
the discussion of (ii) in the case of “v ∈Vgood Vnon”, we may apply [AbsTopI],
Lemma 4.5 [cf. also Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper], to conclude that it
makes sense to speak of the set of cusps of †D , as well as the set of label classes
of cusps
LabCusp(†D )
of †D , which admits a natural Fl -torsor structure.
(vi) Let †D be a category equivalent to D ,
strip. If v ∈V, then we define a poly-morphism †Dv →†D to be a collection of
morphisms †Dv →†D [cf. §0 when v ∈Vnon; (v) when v ∈Varc]. We define a
poly-morphism
†D →†D
to be a collection of poly-morphisms {†Dv →†D }v∈V. Finally, if {eD}e∈E is a
capsule of D-prime-strips, then we define a poly-morphism
{eD}e∈E →†D (respectively, {eD}e∈E →†D)
†D= {†Dv}v∈V a D-prime-
98 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
tobeacollectionofpoly-morphisms{eD →†D }e∈E (respectively,{eD →†D}e∈E).
The following result follows immediately from the discussion of Definition 4.1,
(ii).
Proposition 4.2. (The Set of Label Classes of Cusps of a Base-Prime-
Strip) Let †D= {†Dv}v∈V be a D-prime-strip. Then for any v,w ∈V, there
exist bijections
LabCusp(†Dv)∼
→LabCusp(†Dw)
that are uniquely determined by the condition that they be compatible with
the assignments †ηv
→ †ηw [cf. Definition 4.1, (ii)], as well as with the Fl-
torsor structures on either side. In particular, these bijections are preserved
by arbitrary isomorphisms of D-prime-strips. Thus, by identifying the various
“LabCusp(†Dv)” via these bijections, it makes sense to write LabCusp(†D).
Finally, LabCusp(†D) is equipped with a canonical element, arising from the †ηv
[for v ∈V], as well as a natural Fl -torsor structure; in particular, this canonical
element and Fl -torsor structure determine a natural bijection
LabCusp(†D)∼
→ Fl
that is preserved by isomorphisms of D-prime-strips.
Remark 4.2.1. Note that if, in Examples 3.3, 3.4 — i.e., at v ∈ Vgood
—
one defines “Dv” by means of “Cv” instead of “X
− →v
”, then there does not exist
a system of bijections as in Proposition 4.2. Indeed, by the Tchebotarev density
theorem[cf., e.g., [Lang], ChapterVIII,§4, Theorem10], itfollowsimmediatelythat
there exist v ∈V such that, for a suitable embedding Gal(K/F) →GL2(Fl), the
decomposition subgroup in Gal(K/F) →GL2(Fl) determined [up to conjugation]
by v is equal to the subgroup of diagonal matrices with determinant 1. Thus, if
†D= {†Dv}v∈V,
†D= {†Dv}v∈V are as in Definition 4.1, (i), then for such a v, the
automorphism group of †Dv acts transitively on the set of label classes of cusps of
†Dv, while the automorphism group of †Dw acts trivially [by [EtTh], Corollary 2.9]
on the set of label classes of cusps of †Dw for any w ∈Vbad
.
Example 4.3. Model Base-NF-Bridges. In the following, we construct the
“models” for the notion of a “base-NF-bridge” [cf. Definition 4.6, (i), below].
(i) Write
Autϵ(CK) ⊆ Aut(CK)∼
= Out(ΠCK )∼
= Aut(D )
— where the first “∼
=” follows, for instance, from [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 — for
the subgroup of elements which fix the cusp ϵ. Now let us recall that the profi-
nite group ΔX may be reconstructed group-theoretically from ΠCK [cf. [AbsTopII],
Corollary 3.3, (i), (ii); [AbsTopII], Remark 3.3.2; [AbsTopI], Example 4.8]. Since

inner automorphisms of ΠCK clearly act by multiplication by ±1 on the l-torsion
points of EF [i.e., on Δab
X ⊗Fl], we obtain a natural homomorphism Out(ΠCK ) →
Aut(Δab
X ⊗Fl)/{±1}. Thus, it follows immediately from the discussion of the nota-
tion “K”, “CK”, and “ϵ” in Definition 3.1, (c), (d), (f) [cf. also Remark 3.1.5; the
discussion preceding [EtTh], Definition 2.1; the discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.6.1],
that, relativetoanisomorphismAut(Δab

def = Gal(F/Fmod) on
the l-torsion points of EF [cf. the homomorphism of the display of Definition 3.1,
(c); the model “CFmod” discussed in Remark 3.1.7], then the images of the groups
Autϵ(CK), Aut(CK) may be identified with the subgroups consisting of elements
of the form

[cf. Remark 3.1.7, (iii)] and
V±un def = Autϵ(CK)·V ⊆ VBor def = Aut(CK)·V ⊆ V(K)
for the resulting subsets of V(K). Thus, one verifies immediately that the subgroup
Autϵ(CK) ⊆Aut(CK) is normal, and that we have natural isomorphisms
AutSL(CK)/AutSL
ϵ (CK)∼
→ Aut(CK)/Autϵ(CK)∼
→ Fl
— so we may think of VBor as the Fl -orbit of V±un. Also, we observe that [in light
of the above discussion] it follows immediately that there exists a group-theoretic
algorithm for reconstructing, from π1(D ) [i.e., an isomorph of ΠCK ] the subgroup
Autϵ(D ) ⊆Aut(D )
determined by Autϵ(CK).
(ii) Let v ∈Vnon. Then the natural restriction functor on finite ´ etale coverings

(iv) For each j ∈Fl , let
Dj= {Dvj }v∈V
— where we use the notation vj to denote the pair (j,v) — be a copy of the
“tautological D-prime-strip” {Dv}v∈V. Let us denote by
φNF

[where, by abuse of notation, we write “1” for the element of Fl determined by 1]
the poly-morphism determined by the collection {φNF
v1
: Dv1

the poly-morphisms φNF
v constructed in (ii), (iii). Note that φNF
1 is stabilized by the
action of Autϵ(CK) on D . Thus, it makes sense to consider, for arbitrary j ∈Fl ,
the poly-morphism
φNF
j : Dj →D
obtained [via any isomorphism D1
∼

[i.e., action via poly-automorphisms — cf. (i)] of j ∈Fl on D . Let us write
D def

for the capsule of D-prime-strips indexed by j ∈Fl [cf. Definition 4.1, (iv)] and
denote by
φNF : D →D
the poly-morphism given by the collection of poly-morphisms {φNF
j }j∈Fl
. Thus,
φNF is equivariant with respect to the natural poly-action of Fl on D and the
natural permutation poly-action of Fl , via capsule-full [cf. §0] poly-automorphisms,

of Fl on the collection of data (D ,D ,φNF).

Remark 4.3.1.
(i) Suppose, for simplicity, in the following discussion that F= Fmod. Note
that the morphism of schemes Spec(K) →Spec(F) [or, equivalently, the homomor-
phism of rings F →K] does not admit a section. This nonexistence of a section
is closely related to the nonexistence of a “global multiplicative subspace” of the
sort discussed in [HASurII], Remark 3.7. In the context of loc. cit., this nonexis-
tence of a “global multiplicative subspace” may be thought of as a concrete way
of representing the principal obstruction to applying the scheme-theoretic Hodge-
Arakelov theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] to diophantine geometry. From this point
of view, if one thinks of the ring structure of F, K as a sort of “arithmetic holo-
morphic structure” [cf. [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.2, (ii)], then one may think of
the [D-]prime-strips that appear in the discussion of Example 4.3 as defining, via
the arrows φNF
j of Example 4.3, (iv),
“arithmetic collections of local analytic sections” of Spec(K) →Spec(F)
— cf. Fig. 4.1 below, where each “·−·−
...
−·−·” represents a [D-]prime-strip.
In fact, if, for the sake of brevity, we abbreviate the phrase “collection of local an-
alytic” by the term “local-analytic”, then each of these sections may be thought of
as yielding not only an “arithmetic local-analytic global multiplicative sub-
space”, but also an “arithmetic local-analytic global canonical generator”
[i.e., up to multiplication by ±1, of the quotient of the module of l-torsion points of
the elliptic curve in question by the “arithmetic local-analytic global multiplicative
subspace”]. We refer to Remark 4.9.1, (i), below, for more on this point of view.

Fig. 4.1: Prime-strips as “sections” of Spec(K) →Spec(F)
(ii) The way in which these “arithmetic local-analytic sections” constituted
by the [D-]prime-strips fail to be [globally] “arithmetically holomorphic” may be
understood from several closely related points of view. The first point of view was
already noted above in (i) — namely:
(a) these sections fail to extend to ring homomorphisms K →F.
The second point of view involves the classical phenomenon of decomposition of
primes in extensions of number fields. The decomposition of primes in extensions
102 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
of number fields may be represented by a tree, as in Fig. 4.2, below. If one thinks
of the tree in large parentheses of Fig. 4.2 as representing the decomposition of
primes over a prime v of F in extensions of F [such as K!], then the “arithmetic
local-analytic sections” constituted by the D-prime-strips may be thought of as
(b) an isomorphism, or identification, between v [i.e., a prime of F] and
v′ [i.e., a prime of K] which [manifestly — cf., e.g., [NSW], Theorem
12.2.5] fails to extend to an isomorphism between the respective prime
decomposition trees over v and v′
.
If one thinks of the relation “∈” between sets in axiomatic set theory as determining
a “tree”, then
thepointofviewof(b)isreminiscentofthepointofviewof[IUTchIV],§3,
where one is concerned with constructing some sort of artificial solution to
the “membership equation a ∈a” [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark
3.3.1, (i)].
The third point of view consists of the observation that although the “arithmetic
local-analytic sections” constituted by the D-prime-strips involve isomorphisms of
the various local absolute Galois groups,
(c) these isomorphisms of local absolute Galois groups fail to extend to a
section of global absolute Galois groups GF GK [i.e., a section of the
natural inclusion GK →GF].
Here, we note that in fact, by the Neukirch-Uchida theorem [cf. [NSW], Chapter
XII, §2], one may think of (a) and (c) as essentially equivalent. Moreover, (b) is
closely related to this equivalence, in the sense that the proof [cf., e.g., [NSW],
Chapter XII, §2] of the Neukirch-Uchida theorem depends in an essential fashion
on a careful analysis of the prime decomposition trees of the number fields involved.

Fig. 4.2: Prime decomposition trees
(iii) In some sense, understanding more precisely the content of the failure of
these “arithmetic local-analytic sections” constituted by the D-prime-strips to be
“arithmetically holomorphic” is a central theme of the theory of the present series
of papers — a theme which is very much in line with the spirit of classical complex
Teichm¨ uller theory.
Remark 4.3.2. The incompatibility of the “arithmetic local-analytic sections” of
Remark 4.3.1, (i), with global prime distributions and global absolute Galois groups
[cf. the discussion of Remark 4.3.1, (ii)] is precisely the technical obstacle that
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 103
will necessitate the application — in [IUTchIII] — of the absolute p-adic mono-
anabelian geometry developed in [AbsTopIII], in the form of “panalocalization along
the various prime-strips” [cf. [IUTchIII] for more details]. Indeed,
the mono-anabelian theory developed in [AbsTopIII] represents the cul-
mination of earlier research of the author during the years 2000 to 2007
concerning absolute p-adic anabelian geometry — research that was
motivated precisely by the goal of developing a geometry that would allow
one to work with the “arithmetic local-analytic sections” constituted by
the prime-strips, so as to overcome the principal technical obstruction to
applying the Hodge-Arakelov theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] [cf. Remark
4.3.1, (i)].
Note that the “desired geometry” in question will also be subject to other require-
ments. For instance, in [IUTchIII] [cf. also [IUTchII], §4], we shall make essential
use of the global arithmetic — i.e., the ring structure and absolute Galois groups —
of number fields. As observed above in Remark 4.3.1, (ii), these global arithmetic
structures are not compatible with the “arithmetic local-analytic sections” consti-
tuted by the prime-strips. In particular, this state of aﬀairs imposes the further
requirement that the “geometry” in question be compatible with globalization, i.e.,
that it give rise to the global arithmetic of the number fields in question in a fashion
that is independent of the various local geometries that appear in the “arithmetic
local-analytic sections” constituted by the prime-strips, but nevertheless admits lo-
calization operations to these various local geometries [cf. Fig. 4.3; the discussion
of [IUTchII], Remark 4.11.2, (iii); [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.7.6, (iii), (v)].

Fig. 4.3: Globalizability
Finally, inorderforthe“desiredgeometry”tobeapplicabletothetheorydeveloped
in the present series of papers, it is necessary for it to be based on“´ etale-like
structures”, so as to give rise to canonical splittings, as in the´ etale-picture discussed
in Corollary 3.9, (i). Thus, in summary, the requirements that we wish to impose
on the “desired geometry” are the following:
(a) local independence of global structures,
(b) globalizability, in a fashion that is independent of local structures,
(c) the property of being based on´ etale-like structures.
Note, in particular, that properties (a), (b) at first glance almost appear to con-
tradict one another. In particular, the simultaneous realization of (a), (b) is highly
104 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
nontrivial. For instance, in the case of a function field of dimension one over a
base field, the simultaneous realization of properties (a), (b) appears to require
that one restrict oneself essentially to working with structures that descend to the
base field! It is thus a highly nontrivial consequence of the theory of [AbsTopIII]
that the mono-anabelian geometry of [AbsTopIII] does indeed satisfy all of these
requirements (a), (b), (c) [cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I1].
Remark 4.3.3.
(i) One important theme of [AbsTopIII] is the analogy between the mono-
anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII] and the theory of Frobenius-invariant indige-
nous bundles of the sort that appear in p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory [cf. [AbsTopIII],
§I5]. In fact, [although this point of view is not mentioned in [AbsTopIII]] one may
“compose” this analogy with the analogy between the p-adic and complex theo-
ries discussed in [pOrd], Introduction; [pTeich], Introduction, §0, and consider the
analogy between the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII] and the classical ge-
ometry of the upper half-plane H. In addition to being more elementary than
the p-adic theory, this analogy with the classical geometry of the upper half-plane
H also has the virtue that
since it revolves around the canonical K¨ ahler metric — i.e., the Poin-
car´ e metric — on the upper half-plane, it renders more transparent the
relationship between the theory of the present series of papers and clas-
sical Arakelov theory [which also revolves, to a substantial extent, around
K¨ ahler metrics at the archimedean primes].
(ii) The essential content of the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII] may be
summarized by the diagram
Π k× log −→ k Π (∗)
— where k is a finite extension of Qp; k is an algebraic closure of k; Π is the arith-
metic fundamental group of a hyperbolic orbicurve over k; log is the p-adic loga-
rithm [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I1]. On the other hand, if (E,∇E) denotes the “tautological
indigenous bundle” on H [i.e., the first de Rham cohomology of the tautological
elliptic curve over H], then one has a natural Hodge filtration 0 →ω →E→τ →0
def
[where ω, τ
= ω−1 are holomorphic line bundles on H], together with a natural
complex conjugation operation ιE : E→E. The composite
ω → E ιE −→ E τ
then determines an Hermitian metric |−|ω on ω. For any trivializing section f of
ω, the (1,1)-form
def

isthecanonical K¨ ahler metric[i.e., Poincar´ emetric]onH. Thenonecanalready
identify various formal similarities between κH and the diagram (∗) reviewed above:
Indeed, at a purely formal [but by no means coincidental!] level, the “log” that
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 105
appears in the definition of κH is reminiscent of the “log-Frobenius operation” log.
At a less formal level, the “Galois group” Π is reminiscent — cf. the point of view
that “Galois groups are arithmetic tangent bundles”, a point of view that underlies
the theory of the arithmetic Kodaira-Spencer morphism discussed in [HASurI]! —
of ∂. If one thinks of complex conjugation as a sort of “archimedean Frobenius” [cf.
[pTeich], Introduction, §0], then ∂ is reminiscent of the “Galois group” Π operating
on the opposite side [cf. ιE] of the log-Frobenius operation log. The Hodge filtration
of Ecorresponds to the ring structures of the copies of k on either side of log [cf.
the discussion of [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.7.2]. Finally, perhaps most importantly
from the point of view of the theory of the present series of papers:
the fact that log-shells play the role in the theory of [AbsTopIII] of “canon-
ical rigid integral structures” [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I1] — i.e., “canonical stan-
dard units of volume” — is reminiscent of the fact that the K¨ ahler metric
κH also plays the role of determining a canonical notion of volume on H.
(iii) From the point of view of the analogy discussed in (ii), property (a) of
Remark 4.3.2 may be thought of as corresponding to the local representabil-
ity via the [positive] (1,1)-form κH — on, say, a compact quotient S of H — of
the [positive] global degree of [the result of descending to S] the line bundle ω;
property (b) of Remark 4.3.2 may be thought of as corresponding to the fact that
this (1,1)-form κH that gives rise to a local representation on S of the notion of
a positive global degree not only exists locally on S, but also admits a canonical
global extension to the entire Riemann surface S which may be related to the
algebraic theory [i.e., of algebraic rational functions on S].
(iv) The analogy discussed in (ii) may be summarized as follows:
mono-anabelian theory geometry of the upper-half plane H
the Galois group Π the diﬀerential operator ∂
the Galois group Π on the opposite side of log ∂
the diﬀerential operator
the ring structures of the copies of k on either side of log the Hodge filtration of E,

Example 4.4. Model Base-Θ-Bridges. In the following, we construct the
“models” for the notion of a “base-Θ-bridge” [cf. Definition 4.6, (ii), below]. We
continue to use the notation of Example 4.3.
(i) Let v ∈Vbad. Recall that there is a natural bijection between the set
|Fl| def
= Fl/{±1}= 0 Fl
106 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
[i.e., the set of {±1}-orbits of Fl] and the set of cusps of the hyperbolic orbicurve
Cv [cf. [EtTh], Corollary 2.9]. Thus, [by considering fibers over Cv] we obtain
labels ∈|Fl|of various collections of cusps of Xv, X
. Write
v
μ− ∈Xv(Kv)
for the unique torsion point of order 2 whose closure in any stable model of Xv
over OKv intersects the same irreducible component of the special fiber of the stable
model as the [unique] cusp labeled 0 ∈|Fl|. Now observe that it makes sense to
speak of the points ∈Xv(Kv) obtained as μ−-translates of the cusps, relative to the
group scheme structure of the elliptic curve determined by Xv [i.e., whose origin
is given by the cusp labeled 0 ∈|Fl|]. We shall refer to these μ−-translates of the
cusps with labels ∈|Fl|as the evaluation points of Xv. Note that the value of
the theta function “Θ
v” of Example 3.2, (ii), at a point lying over an evaluation
point arising from a cusp with label j ∈|Fl|is contained in the μ2l-orbit of
j2
{q
}j ≡ j
v
[cf. Example 3.2, (iv); [EtTh], Proposition 1.4, (ii)] — where j ranges over the
elements of Z that map to j ∈|Fl|. In particular, it follows immediately from the
definition of the covering X
→Xv [i.e., by considering l-th roots of the theta
v
function! — cf. [EtTh], Definition 2.5, (i)] that the points of X
that lie over
v
evaluation points of Xv are all defined over Kv. We shall refer to the points
∈X
v(Kv) that lie over the evaluation points of Xv as the evaluation points of X
v
and to the various sections
Gv →Πv = Πtp
X
v
of the natural surjection Πv Gv that arise from the evaluation points as the
evaluation sections of Πv Gv. Thus, each evaluation section has an associ-
ated label ∈|Fl|. Note that there is a group-theoretic algorithm for constructing
the evaluation sections from [isomorphs of] the topological group Πv. Indeed, this

vj , the induced homomorphism
π1(Dvj ) →π1(D>,v) [well-defined, up to composition with an inner automorphism]
is compatible with the respective outer actions [of the domain and codomain of this

LabCusp(D>) [cf. Proposition 4.2] — determined by the various collections of
evaluation sections corresponding to a given j ∈ Fl are held fixed by arbitrary
automorphisms of D> [cf. Proposition 4.2].
Example 4.5. Transport of Label Classes of Cusps via Model Base-
Bridges. We continue to use the notation of Examples 4.3, 4.4.
(i) Let j ∈Fl , v ∈V. Recall from Example 4.3, (iv), that the data of the
arrow φNF
j : Dj →D at v consists of an arrow φNF
vj
: Dvj
→D . If v ∈Vnon, then
φNF

2.5 when v ∈Vbad; the discussion of Remark 4.5.1 below],
weconcludethatthesehomomorphismsinduceanatural isomorphism of Fl -torsors
LabCusp(D )∼
→LabCusp(Dvj ). In a similar vein, if v ∈Varc, then it follows from
Definition 4.1, (v), that φNF
vj consists of certain morphisms of Aut-holomorphic
orbispaces which induce various outer homomorphisms π1(Dvj ) →π1(D ) from
the [discrete] topological fundamental group π1(Dvj ) to the profinite group π1(D );
thus,
by considering the closures in π1(D ) of the images of cuspidal inertia
groups of π1(Dvj ) [cf. the discussion of Remark 4.5.1 below],
weconcludethatthesehomomorphismsinduceanatural isomorphism of Fl -torsors
LabCusp(D )∼
→LabCusp(Dvj ). Now let us observe that it follows immediately
from the definitions that, as one allows v to vary, these isomorphisms of Fl -torsors
LabCusp(D )∼
→LabCusp(Dvj ) are compatible with the natural bijections in the
first display of Proposition 4.2, hence determine an isomorphism of Fl -torsors
LabCusp(D )∼
→LabCusp(Dj). Next, let us note that the data of the arrow
φΘ
j : Dj →D> at the various v ∈V determines an isomorphism of Fl -torsors
LabCusp(Dj)∼
→LabCusp(D>) [which may be composed with the previous isomor-
phism of Fl -torsors LabCusp(D )∼
→LabCusp(Dj)]. Indeed, this is immediate
from the definitions when v ∈Vgood; when v ∈Vbad, it follows immediately from
the discussion of Example 4.4, (ii).
(ii) The discussion of (i) may be summarized as follows:
for each j ∈Fl , restriction at the various v ∈V via φNF
j , φΘ
j determines
an isomorphism of Fl -torsors
φLC
j : LabCusp(D )∼
→LabCusp(D>)
such that φLC
j is obtained from φLC
1 by composing with the action by
j ∈Fl.
Write [ϵ] ∈LabCusp(D ) for the element determined by ϵ. Then we observe that
φLC
j ([ϵ]) →j; φLC
1 (j·[ϵ]) →j
via the natural bijection LabCusp(D>)∼
→Fl of Proposition 4.2. In particular,
the element [ϵ] ∈LabCusp(D ) may be characterized as the unique element η ∈
LabCusp(D ) such that evaluation at η yields the assignment φLC
j →j.
Remark 4.5.1.
(i) Let G be a group. If H ⊆G is a subgroup, g ∈G, then we shall write
Hg def
= g·H·g−1. Let J ⊆H ⊆G be subgroups. Suppose further that each of the
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 109
subgroups J, H of G is only known up to conjugacy in G. Put another way, we
suppose that we are in a situation in which there are independent G-conjugacy
indeterminaciesinthespecificationofthesubgroupsJ andH. Thus, forinstance,
there is no natural way to distinguish the given inclusion ι : J →H from its γ-
conjugate ιγ : Jγ →Hγ, for γ ∈G. Moreover, it may happen to be the case that
for some g ∈G, not only J, but also Jg ⊆H [or, equivalently J ⊆Hg−1]. Here, the
subgroups J, Jg of H are not necessarily conjugate in H; indeed, the abstract pairs
of a group and a subgroup given by (H,J) and (H,Jg) need not be isomorphic
[i.e., it is not even necessarily the case that there exists an automorphism of H
that maps J onto Jg]. In particular, the existence of the independent G-conjugacy
indeterminacies in the specification of J and H means that one cannot specify the
inclusion ι : J →H independently of the inclusion ζ : J →Hg−1 [i.e., arising from
Jg ⊆H]. One way to express this state of aﬀairs is as follows. Write “ out
→ ”
for the outer homomorphism determined by an injective homomorphism between
groups. Then the collection of factorizations J out
→ H out
→ G of the natural
“outer” inclusion J out
→ G through some G-conjugate of H — i.e., put another
way,
the collection of outer homomorphisms
J out
→ H
that are compatible with the “structure morphisms” J out
→ G,
H out
→ G determined by the natural inclusions
— is well-defined, in a fashion that is compatible with independent G-conjugacy
indeterminacies in the specification of J and H. That is to say, this collection
of outer homomorphisms amounts to the collection of inclusions Jg1 →Hg2, for
g1,g2 ∈G. By contrast, to specify the inclusion ι : J →H [together with, say,
its G-conjugates {ιγ}γ∈G] independently of the inclusion ζ : J →Hg−1 [and its G-
conjugates {ζγ}γ∈G] amounts to the imposition of a partial synchronization—
i.e., a partial deactivation — of the [a priori!] independent G-conjugacy indeter-
minacies in the specification of J and H. Moreover, such a “partial deactivation”
can only be eﬀected at the cost of introducing certain arbitrary choices into the
construction under consideration.
(ii) Relative to the factorizations considered in (i), we make the following
observation. Given a G-conjugate H∗ of H and a subgroup I ⊆H∗, the condition
on I that
(∗⊆) I be a G-conjugate of J
is a condition that is independent of the datum H∗, while the condition on I that
(∗
∼
=) I be a G-conjugate of J such that (H∗,I)∼
= (H,J)
[where the “∼
=” denotes an isomorphism of pairs consisting of a group and a sub-
group — cf. the discussion of (i)] is a condition that depends, in an essential fashion,
on the datum H∗. Here, (∗⊆) is precisely the condition that one must impose when
one considers arbitrary factorizations as in (i), while (∗
∼
=) is the condition that one
must impose when one wishes to restrict one’s attention to factorizations whose
110 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
first arrow gives rise to a pair isomorphic to the pair determined by ι. That is to
say, the dependence of (∗
∼
=) on the datum H∗ may be regarded as an explicit formu-
lation of the necessity for the “imposition of a partial synchronization” as discussed
in (i), while the corresponding independence, exhibited by (∗⊆), of the datum H∗
may be regarded as an explicit formulation of the lack of such a necessity when one
considers arbitrary factorizations as in (i). Finally, we note that by reversing the
direction of the inclusion “⊆”, one may consider a subgroup I ⊆G that contains a
given G-conjugate J∗ of J, i.e., I ⊇J∗; then analogous observations may be made
concerning the condition (∗⊇) on I that I be a G-conjugate of H.
(iii) The abstract situation described in (i) occurs in the discussion of Example
4.5, (i), at v ∈Vbad. That is to say, the group “G” (respectively, “H”; “J”) of (i)
corresponds to the group π1(D ) (respectively, the image of π1(Dvj ) in π1(D ); the
uniqueindexl opensubgroupofacuspidalinertiagroupofπ1(D ))ofExample4.5,
(i). Here, we recall that the homomorphism π1(Dvj ) →π1(D ) is only known up to
composition with an inner automorphism — i.e., up to π1(D )-conjugacy; a cuspi-
dal inertia group of π1(D ) is also only determined by an element ∈LabCusp(D )
up to π1(D )-conjugacy. Moreover, it is immediate from the construction of the
“model D-NF-bridges” of Example 4.3 [cf. also Definition 4.6, (i), below] that there
is no natural way to synchronize these indeterminacies. Indeed, from the
point of view of the discussion of Remark 4.3.1, (ii), by considering the actions of
the absolute Galois groups of the local and global base fields involved on the cuspi-
dal inertia groups that appear, one sees that such a synchronization would amount,
roughly speaking, to a Galois-equivariant splitting [i.e., relative to the global abso-
lute Galois groups that appear] of the “prime decomposition trees” of Remark 4.3.1,
(ii) — which is absurd [cf. [IUTchII], Remark 2.5.2, (iii), for a more detailed discus-
sion of this sort of phenomenon]. This phenomenon of the “non-synchronizability”
of indeterminacies arising from local and global absolute Galois groups is reminis-
cent of the discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.2. On the other hand, by Corollary
2.5, one concludes in the present situation the highly nontrivial fact that
a factorization “J →H →G” is uniquely determined by the com-
posite J →G, i.e., by the G-conjugate of J that one starts with, without
resorting to any a priori “synchronization of indeterminacies”.
(iv) A similar situation to the situation of (iii) occurs in the discussion of
Example 4.5, (i), at v ∈Varc. That is to say, in this case, the group “G” (re-
spectively, “H”; “J”) of (i) corresponds to the group π1(D ) (respectively, the
image of π1(Dvj ) in π1(D ); a cuspidal inertia group of π1(Dvj )) of Example 4.5,
(i). In this case, although it does not hold that a factorization“J →H →G” is
uniquely determined by the composite J →G, i.e., by the G-conjugate of J that
one starts with [cf. Remark 2.6.1], it does nevertheless hold, by Corollary 2.8, that
the H-conjugacy class of the image of J via the arrow J →H that occurs in such
a factorization is uniquely determined.
(v) The property observed at v ∈Varc in (iv) is somewhat weaker than the
rather strong property observed at v ∈Vbad in (iii). In the present series of pa-
pers, however, we shall only be concerned with such subtle factorization proper-
ties at v ∈Vbad, where we wish to develop, in [IUTchII], the theory of “Hodge-

Arakelov-theoretic evaluation” by restricting certain cohomology classes via an ar-
row “J →H” appearing in a factorization“J →H →G” of the sort discussed
in (i). In fact, in the context of the theory of Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation
that will be developed in [IUTchII], a slightly modified version of the phenome-
non discussed in (iii) — which involves the “additive” version to be developed in
§6 of the “multiplicative” theory developed in the present §4 — will be of central
importance.

(i) The structure at the various v ∈Vbad of the D-Θ-bridge †φΘ [i.e., in-
volving evaluation sections — cf. Example 4.4, (i), (ii); Definition 4.6, (ii)]
determines a bijection

[where the bijection in parentheses is the bijection †χ of (i)] between “global
cusps” [i.e., “†χ(j)·[†ϵ]”] and capsule indices [i.e., j ∈J∼
→Fl ]. Finally,
when considered up to composition with multiplication by an element of Fl , the
bijection †ζ is independent of the choice of †φNF within the Fl -orbit of †φNF
relative to the natural poly-action of Fl on †D [cf. Example 4.3, (iv); Fig. 4.4
below].
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from the definitions [cf. Example 4.4,
(i), (ii), (iv); Definition 4.6], together with the bijection of the second display of
Proposition 4.2. Assertions (ii) and (iii) follow immediately from the intrinsic
nature of the constructions of Example 4.5. ⃝
Remark 4.7.1. The significance of the natural bijection †ζ of Proposition 4.7,
(iii), lies in the following observation: Suppose that one wishes to work with the
global data †D in a fashion that is independent of the local data [i.e., “prime-strip
data”] †D>,
†DJ [cf. Remark 4.3.2, (b)]. Then
by replacing the capsule index set J by the set of global label classes of
cuspsLabCusp(†D )via†ζ , oneobtainsanobject—i.e., LabCusp(†D )
— constructed via [i.e., “native to”] the global data that is immune to the
“collapsing” of J∼
→Fl — i.e., of Fl -orbits of V±un
— even at primes
v ∈V of the sort discussed in Remark 4.2.1!
That is to say, this “collapsing” of [i.e., failure of Fl to act freely on] Fl -orbits
of V±un is a characteristically global consequence of the global prime decomposition
treesdiscussedinRemark4.3.1, (ii)[cf. theexamplediscussedinRemark4.2.1]. We
refer to Remark 4.9.3, (ii), below for a discussion of a closely related phenomenon.
Remark 4.7.2.
(i) At the level of labels [cf. the content of Proposition 4.7], the structure of a
D-ΘNF-Hodge theater may be summarized via the diagram of Fig. 4.4 below — i.e.,
wheretheexpression“[1 < 2 < ... < (l−1) < l ]”correspondsto†D>; the
expression “(1 2 ... l−1 l )” corresponds to †DJ; the lower right-
hand “Fl -cycle of ’s” corresponds to †D ; the “⇑” corresponds to the associated
D-Θ-bridge; the “⇒” corresponds to the associated D-NF-bridge; the “/ ’s” denote
D-prime-strips.
(ii) Note that the labels arising from †D> correspond, ultimately, to various
irreducible components in the special fiber of a certain tempered covering of a
[“geometric”!] Tate curve [a special fiber which consists of a chain of copies
of the projective line — cf. [EtTh], Corollary 2.9]. In particular, these labels are
obtainedbycounting—inanintuitive, archimedean, additivefashion—thenumber
of irreducible components between a given irreducible component and the “origin”.
That is to say, the portion of the diagram of Fig. 4.4 corresponding to †D> may
be described by the following terms:
geometric, additive, archimedean, hence Frobenius-like [cf. Corol-
lary 3.8].
114 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
By contrast, the various “ ’s” in the portion of the diagram of Fig. 4.4 correspond-
ing to †D arise, ultimately, from various primes of an [“arithmetic”!] number
field. These primes are permuted by the multiplicative group Fl = F×
l /{±1}, in a
cyclic — i.e., nonarchimedean — fashion. Thus, the portion of the diagram of Fig.
4.4 corresponding to †D may be described by the following terms:
arithmetic, multiplicative, nonarchimedean, hence´ etale-like [cf.
the discussion of Remark 4.3.2].
That is to say, the portions of the diagram of Fig. 4.4 corresponding to †D>,
†D
diﬀer quite fundamentally in structure. In particular, it is not surprising that the
only “common ground” of these two fundamentally structurally diﬀerent portions
consists of an underlying set of cardinality l [i.e., the portion of the diagram of
Fig. 4.4 corresponding to †DJ].
(iii) The bijection †ζ — or, perhaps more appropriately, its inverse
(†ζ )−1 : J∼
→LabCusp(†D )
— may be thought of as relating arithmetic [i.e., if one thinks of the elements of
the capsule index set J as collections of primes of a number field] to geometry [i.e.,
if one thinks of the elements of LabCusp(†D ) as corresponding to the [geometric!]
cusps of the hyperbolic orbicurve]. From this point of view,
(†ζ )−1 maybethoughtofasasortof“combinatorial Kodaira-Spencer
morphism” [cf. the point of view of [HASurI], §1.4].

The following result follows immediately from the definitions.

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 115
Proposition 4.8. (First Properties of Base-NF-Bridges, Base-Θ-Bridges,
and Base-ΘNF-Hodge Theaters) Relative to a fixed collection of initial Θ-
data:
(i) The set of isomorphisms between two D-NF-bridges forms an Fl-
torsor.
(ii) The set of isomorphisms between two D-Θ-bridges (respectively, two
D-ΘNF-Hodge theaters) is of cardinality one.
(iii) Given a D-NF-bridge and a D-Θ-bridge, the set of capsule-full poly-
isomorphisms between the respective capsules of D-prime-strips which allow one to
glue the given D-NF- and D-Θ-bridges together to form a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater
forms an Fl -torsor.
(iv) Given a D-NF-bridge, there exists a [relatively simple — cf. the discussion
of Examples 4.4, (i), (ii), (iii); 4.5, (i), (ii)] functorial algorithm for construct-
ing, up to an Fl -indeterminacy [cf. (i), (iii)], from the given D-NF-bridge a
D-ΘNF-Hodge theater whose underlying D-NF-bridge is the given D-NF-bridge.
Proposition 4.9. (Symmetries arising from Forgetful Functors) Relative
to a fixed collection of initial Θ-data:
(i) (Base-NF-Bridges) The operation of associating to a D-ΘNF-Hodge the-
ater the underlying D-NF-bridge of the D-ΘNF-Hodge theater determines a natural
functor
category of

the index set [i.e., “J”] of the underlying capsule of D-prime-strips [i.e., “†DJ”] of
this output data.

whose output data admits an Sl -symmetry [where we write Sl for the symmet-
ric group on l letters] which acts transitively on the index set [i.e., “J”] of this
output data. Thus, this functor may be thought of as an operation that consists of
forgetting the labels ∈Fl [i.e., forgetting the bijection J∼
→Fl of Proposition
4.7, (i)]. In particular, if one is only given this output data †DJ up to isomorphism,
then there is a total of precisely l possibilities for the element ∈Fl to which a
given index j ∈J corresponds [cf. Proposition 4.7, (i)], prior to the application of
this functor.
(iii) (Mono-analytic Capsules) By composing the functor of (ii) with the
mono-analyticization operation discussed in Definition 4.1, (iv), one obtains a
natural functor

whose output data satisfies the same symmetry properties with respect to labels as
the output data of the functor of (ii).
Proof. Assertions (i), (ii), (iii) follow immediately from the definitions [cf. also
Proposition 4.8, (i), in the case of assertion (i)]. ⃝
Remark 4.9.1.
(i) Ultimately, in the theory of the present series of papers [cf., especially,
[IUTchII], §2], we shall be interested in
evaluating the´ etale theta function of [EtTh] — i.e., in the spirit of
the Hodge-Arakelov theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] — at the various
D-prime-strips of †DJ, in the fashion stipulated by the labels discussed
in Proposition 4.7, (i).
These values of the ´ etale theta function will be used to construct various arithmetic
line bundles. We shall be interested in computing the arithmetic degrees — in
the form of various “log-volumes” — of these arithmetic line bundles. In order to
compute these global log-volumes, it is necessary to be able to compare the log-
volumes that arise at D-prime-strips with diﬀerent labels. It is for this reason that
the non-labeled output data of the functors of Proposition 4.9, (i), (ii), (iii) [cf. also
Proposition 4.11, (i), (ii), below], are of crucial importance in the theory of the
present series of papers. That is to say,
the non-labeled output data of the functors of Proposition 4.9, (i), (ii),
(iii) [cf. also Proposition 4.11, (i), (ii), below] — which allow one to
consider isomorphisms between the D-prime-strips that were originally

assigned diﬀerent labels — make possible the comparison of objects
[e.g., log-volumes] constructed relative to diﬀerent labels.
In Proposition 4.11, (i), (ii), below, we shall see that by considering “processions”,
one may perform such comparisons in a fashion that minimizes the label indeter-
minacy that arises.
(ii) Since the Fl -symmetry that appears in Proposition 4.9, (i), is transitive,
it follows that one may use this action to perform comparisons as discussed in (i).
This prompts the question:
WhatisthediﬀerencebetweenthisFl -symmetryandtheSl -symmetry
of the output data of the functors of Proposition 4.9, (ii), (iii)?
In a word, restricting to the Fl -symmetry of Proposition 4.9, (i), amounts to the
imposition of a “cyclic structure” on the index set J [i.e., a structure of Fl -torsor
on J]. Thus, relative to the issue of comparability raised in (i), this Fl -symmetry
allows comparison between — i.e., involves isomorphisms between the non-labeled
D-prime-strips corresponding to — distinct members of this index set J, without
disturbing the cyclic structure on J. This cyclic structure may be thought of as
a sort of combinatorial manifestation of the link to the global object †D that
appears in a D-NF-bridge. On the other hand,
in order to compare these D-prime-strips indexed by J “in the abso-
lute” to D-prime-strips that have nothing to do with J, it is necessary to
“forget the cyclic structure on J”
.
This is precisely what is achieved by considering the functors of Proposition 4.9,
(ii), (iii), i.e., by working with the “full Sl -symmetry”.
Remark 4.9.2.
(i) The various elements of the index set of the capsule of D-prime-strips of a
D-NF-bridge are synchronized in their correspondence with the labels “1,2,...,l ”,
in the sense that this correspondence is completely determined up to composition
with the action of an element of Fl . In particular, this correspondence is always
bijective.
One may regard this phenomenon of synchronization, or cohesion, as
an important consequence of the fact that the number field in question is
represented in the D-NF-bridge via a single copy [i.e., as opposed to a
capsule whose index set is of cardinality ≥2] of D.
Indeed, consider a situation in which each D-prime-strip in the capsule †DJ is
equipped with its own “independent globalization”, i.e., copy of D , to which it
is related by a copy of “φNF
j ”, which [in order not to invalidate the comparability
of distinct labels — cf. Remark 4.9.1, (i)] is regarded as being known only up to
composition with the action of an element of Fl . Then if one thinks of the [mani-
festly mutually disjoint — cf. Definition 3.1, (f); Example 4.3, (i)] Fl -translates of
V±un V(K)bad [whose union is equal to VBor V(K)bad] as being labeled by the
elements of Fl , then each D-prime-strip in the capsule †DJ — i.e., each “•” in Fig.
4.5 below — is subject, as depicted in Fig. 4.5, to an independent indeterminacy
118 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
concerning the label ∈Fl to which it is associated. In particular, the set of all
possibilities for each association includes correspondences between the index set J
of the capsule †DJ and the set of labels Fl which fail to be bijective. Moreover,
although Fl arises essentially as a subquotient of a Galois group of extensions of
number fields [cf. the faithful poly-action of Fl on primes of V(K)], the fact that
it also acts faithfully on conjugates of the cusp ϵ [cf. Example 4.3, (i)] implies that
“working with elements of V(K) up to Fl -indeterminacy” may only be done at the
expense of “working with conjugates of the cusp ϵ up to Fl -indeterminacy”. That is
to say, “working with nonsynchronized labels” is inconsistent with the construction
of the crucial bijection †ζ in Proposition 4.7, (iii).

Fig. 4.5: Nonsynchronized labels
(ii) In the context of the discussion of (i), we observe that the “single copy” of
D may also be thought of as a “single connected component”, hence — from
the point of view of Galois categories — as a “single basepoint”.
(iii) In the context of the discussion of (i), it is interesting to note that since
the natural action of Fl on Fl is transitive, one obtains the same “set of all
possibilities for each association”, regardless of whether one considers independent
Fl -indeterminacies at each index of J or independent Sl -indeterminacies at each
index of J [cf. the discussion of Remark 4.9.1, (ii)].
(iv) The synchronized indeterminacy [cf. (i)] exhibited by a D-NF-bridge
— i.e., at a more concrete level, the crucial bijection †ζ of Proposition 4.7, (iii) —
may be thought of as a sort of combinatorial model of the notion of a “holo-
morphic structure”. By contrast, the nonsynchronized indeterminacies dis-
cussed in (i) may be thought of as a sort of combinatorial model of the notion of
a “real analytic structure”. Moreover, we observe that the theme of the above
discussion — in which one considers
“how a given combinatorial holomorphic structure is ‘embedded’ within
its underlying combinatorial real analytic structure”
— is very much in line with the spirit of classical complex Teichm¨ uller theory.
(v) From the point of view discussed in (iv), the main results of the “multi-
plicative combinatorial Teichm¨ uller theory” developed in the present §4 may
be summarized as follows:
(a) globalizability of labels, in a fashion that is independent of local structures
[cf. Remark 4.3.2, (b); Proposition 4.7, (iii)];
(b) comparability of distinct labels [cf. Proposition 4.9; Remark 4.9.1, (i)];
(c) absolute comparability [cf. Proposition 4.9, (ii), (iii); Remark 4.9.1, (ii)];
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 119
(d) minimization of label indeterminacy — without sacrificing the symmetry
necessary to perform comparisons! — via processions [cf. Proposition
4.11, (i), (ii), below].
Remark 4.9.3.
(i) Ultimately, in the theory of the present series of papers [cf. [IUTchIII]],
we would like to apply the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII] to the various
local and global arithmetic fundamental groups [i.e., isomorphs of ΠCK , Πv for
v ∈Vnon] that appear in a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater [cf. the discussion of Remark
4.3.2]. To do this, it is of essential importance to have available not only the
absolute Galois groups of the various local and global base fields involved, but
also the geometric fundamental groups that lie inside the isomorphs of ΠCK , Πv
involved. Indeed, in the theory of [AbsTopIII], it is precisely the outer Galois action
of the absolute Galois group of the base field on the geometric fundamental group
that allows one to reconstruct the ring structures group-theoretically in a fashion
that is compatible with localization/globalization operations as shown in Fig. 4.3.
Here, we pause to recall that in [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.3, (i), one may find a
discussion of the analogy between this phenomenon of “entrusting of arithmetic
moduli” [to the outer Galois action on the geometric fundamental group] and the
Kodaira-Spencer isomorphism of an indigenous bundle — an analogy that
is reminiscent of the discussion of Remark 4.7.2, (iii).
(ii) Next, let us observe that the state of aﬀairs discussed in (i) has important
implications concerning the circumstances that necessitate the use of “X
− →v
” [i.e., as
opposed to “Cv”] in the definition of “Dv” in Examples 3.3, 3.4 [cf. Remark 4.2.1].
Indeed, localization/globalization operations as shown in Fig. 4.3 give rise, when
applied to the various geometric fundamental groups involved, to various bijections
between local and global sets of label classes of cusps. Now suppose that one uses
“Cv” instead of “X
− →v
” in the definition of “Dv” in Examples 3.3, 3.4. Then the
existence of v ∈V of the sort discussed in Remark 4.2.1, together with the condition
of compatibility with localization/globalization operations as shown in Fig. 4.3 —
where we take, for instance,
(v of Fig. 4.3) def = (v′ of Fig. 4.3) def = (v of Remark 4.2.1)
(w of Remark 4.2.1)
— imply that, at a combinatorial level, one is led, in eﬀect, to a situation of the
sort discussed in Remark 4.9.2, (i), i.e., a situation involving nonsynchronized
labels [cf. Fig. 4.5], which, as discussed in Remark 4.9.2, (i), is incompatible with
the construction of the crucial bijection †ζ of Proposition 4.7, (iii), an object which
will play an important role in the theory of the present series of papers.

data corresponds, prior to the application of this functor. That is to say, by tak-
ing the product, over elements of Fl , of cardinalities of “sets of possibilies”, one
concludes that
by considering processions — i.e., the functor discussed above, possi-
bly pre-composed with the functor †HTD-ΘNF →†φΘ that associates to
a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater its associated D-Θ-bridge — the indeterminacy
consisting of (l )(l ) possibilities that arises in Proposition 4.9, (ii), is
reduced to an indeterminacy consisting of a total of l ! possibilities.

Section 5: ΘNF-Hodge Theaters
In the present §5, we continue our discussion of various “enhancements” to the
Θ-Hodge theaters of §3. Namely, we define the notion of a ΘNF-Hodge theater
[cf. Definition 5.5, (iii)] and observe that these ΘNF-Hodge theaters satisfy the
same “functorial dynamics” [cf. Corollary 5.6; Remark 5.6.1] as the base-ΘNF-
Hodge theaters discussed in §4.
Let
†HTD-ΘNF = (†D
†φNF
←− †DJ
†φΘ
−→ †D>)
be a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater [cf. Definition 4.6], relative to a fixed collection of initial
Θ-data (F/F, XF, l, CK, V, Vbad
mod, ϵ) as in Definition 3.1.
Example 5.1. Global Frobenioids.
(i) By applying the anabelian result of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, via the
“Θ-approach” discussed in Remark 3.1.2, to π1(†D ), we may construct group-
theoretically from π1(†D ) an isomorph of “F×” — which we shall denote
M (†D )
— equipped with its natural π1(†D )-action. Here, we recall that this construction
includes a reconstruction of the field structure on M (†D ) def
= M (†D ) {0}.
Next, let us recall [cf. Remark 3.1.7, (i)] the unique model CFmod of the F-core CF
over Fmod. Observe that one may construct group-theoretically from π1(†D ), in a
functorial fashion, a profinite group corresponding to “CFmod” [cf. the algorithms of
[AbsTopII], Corollary 3.3, (i), which are applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example
4.8], which contains π1(†D ) as an open subgroup; write †D for B(−)0 of this
profinite group, so we obtain a natural morphism
†D →†D
— i.e., a “category-theoretic version” of the natural morphism of hyperbolic orbi-
curves CK →CFmod — together with a natural extension of the action of π1(†D )
on M (†D ) to π1(†D ). In particular, by taking π1(†D )-invariants, we obtain
a submonoid/subfield
Mmod(†D ) ⊆M (†D ), Mmod(†D ) ⊆M (†D )
correspondingtoF×

1.9, (d), (e)—weconcludethatwemayconstructgroup-theoreticallyfromπ1(†D ),

124 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
of the absolute Galois group of the function field of CFmod [i.e., equipped with its
natural surjection to π1(†D ) and well-defined up to inner automorphisms deter-
mined by elements of the kernel of this natural surjection], as well as isomorphs
of the pseudo-monoids of κ-, ∞κ-, and∞κ×-coric rational functions associated to
CFmod [cf. the discussion of Remark 3.1.7, (i), (ii); [AbsTopII], Corollary 3.3, (iii),
which is applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example 4.8] — which we shall denote
Mκ (†D ), M
∞κ(†D ), M
∞κ×(†D )
— equipped with their natural πrat
1 (†D )-actions. Thus, Mκ (†D ) may be iden-
tified with the subset of πrat
1 (†D )-invariants of M
∞κ(†D ), and M (†D ) may
be identified with a certain subset [i.e., indeed, a certain “sub-pseudo-monoid”!]
of M
∞κ×(†D ). Next, let us observe that it also follows from the group-theoretic
constructions recalled above that one may reconstruct the quotients of π1(†D ),
π1(†D ) that correspond, respectively, to the absolute Galois groups of K, Fmod.
Thus, by forming the quotient of πrat
1 (†D ) by the intersection of the kernel of the
action of πrat
1 (†D ) on M
∞κ(†D ) with the inverse image in πrat
1 (†D ) of the kernel
of the maximal solvable quotient of [the quotient of πrat
1 (†D ) that corresponds to]
the absolute Galois group of Fmod, we obtain a group-theoretic construction for a
quotient
πrat
1 (†D ) πκ-sol
1 (†D )
— whose kernel we denote by π
rat/κ-sol
1 (†D ) — that corresponds to the quotient
“Gal(LC/LC) Gal(LC(κ-sol)/LC)” of Remark 3.1.7, (iv), as well as pseudo-
monoids equipped with natural πκ-sol
1 (†D )-actions
M
∞κ(†D ), Mκ-sol(†D ), Msol(†D )
— where Mκ-sol(†D ), Msol(†D ) denote the respective subsets of π
rat/κ-sol
1 (†D )-
invariants of M
∞κ×(†D ), M (†D ). Moreover, by applying the characterization
of the subgroup “Gal(K/F(μl)) ⊆Gal(K/Fmod)” given in Remark 3.1.7, (iii), we
obtain a group-theoretic construction for subgroups
AutSL
ϵ (†D ) ⊆ AutSL(†D ) ⊆ Aut(†D )
that correspond to the subgroups “AutSL
ϵ (CK) ⊆AutSL(CK) ⊆Aut(CK)” of Ex-
ample 4.3, (i), hence induce natural isomorphisms
AutSL(†D )/AutSL
ϵ (†D )∼
→ Aut(†D )/Autϵ(†D )∼
→ Fl
— i.e., which, in the spirit of Example 4.3, (iv), may be thought of as a poly-
action of Fl on †D . Finally, we observe that although this poly-action of Fl on
πrat
1 (†D ) is only well-defined up to conjugation by elements of the subgroup
πrat
1 (†D ) def

1 (†D )×π1(†D ) π1(†D )

Remark 3.1.7, (iii), that, by regarding this poly-action of Fl as arising from the ac-
tion of elements of AutSL(†D ), one may conclude that, if we write π

1 (†D )
def
rat/κ-sol

1 (†D ) πrat
1 (†D ), then
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 125
the resulting poly-action of Fl on πrat
1 (†D ) is, in fact, well-defined
rat/κ-sol
up to π
1 (†D )-conjugacy indeterminacies, hence, in particular,
that the induced poly-action on [the domain, codomain, and arrow that
constitute] the“κ-sol-outer representation”
πκ-sol
1 (†D ) → Outκ-sol(π
rat/κ-sol
1 (†D ))
— i.e., which may be associated to and is, in fact, equivalent to the exact
rat/κ-sol
sequence 1 →π
1 (†D ) →πrat
1 (†D ) →πκ-sol
1 (†D ) →1, regarded
rat/κ-sol
up to π
1 (†D )-conjugacy indeterminacies [cf. the discussion of Re-
mark 3.1.7, (iv)] — is, in fact, well-defined without any conjugacy
indeterminacies, and, moreover, equal to the trivial action.
We shall refer to this phenomenon [cf. also Remark 5.1.5 below] as the phenomenon
of κ-sol-conjugate synchronization.
(ii) Next, let us recall [cf. Definition 4.1, (v)] that the field structure on
M (†D ) [i.e., “F”] allows one to reconstruct group-theoretically from π1(†D )
the set of valuations V(†D ) [i.e., “V(F)”] on M (†D ) equipped with its natural
π1(†D )-action, hencealsothemonoidon†D [i.e., inthesenseof[FrdI],Definition
1.1, (ii)]
Φ (†D )(−)
that associates to an object A ∈ Ob(†D ) the monoid Φ (†D )(A) of “stack-
theoretic” [cf. Remark 3.1.5] arithmetic divisors on the corresponding subfield
M (†D )A ⊆M (†D ) [i.e., the monoid denoted “Φ(−)” in [FrdI], Example 6.3;
cf. also Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper], together with the natural morphism
of monoids M (†D )A →Φ (†D )(A)gp [cf. the discussion of [FrdI], Example
6.3; Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]. As discussed in [FrdI], Example 6.3 [cf.
also Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper], this data determines, by applying [FrdI],
Theorem 5.2, (ii), a model Frobenioid
F (†D )
over the base category †D.
(iii) Let †F be any category equivalent to F (†D ). Thus, †F is equipped
with a natural Frobenioid structure [cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11; [FrdI], Theorem 6.4,
(i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]; write Base(†F ) for the base category of
this Frobenioid. Suppose further that we have been given a morphism
†D →Base(†F )
which is abstractly equivalent [cf. §0] to the natural morphism †D →†D [cf. (i)].
In the following discussion, we shall use the resulting [uniquely determined, in light
of the F-coricity of CF, together with [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9!] isomorphism
Base(†F )∼
→†D to identify Base(†F ) with †D . Let us denote by
†F def
= †F |†D (→†F )
126 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
the restriction of †F to †D via the natural morphism †D →†D and by
†Fmod
def
= †F |terminal objects (⊆†F )
the restriction of †F to the full subcategory of †D determined by the terminal
objects [i.e., “CFmod”] of †D . Thus, when the data denoted here by the label “†”
arises [in the evident sense] from data as discussed in Definition 3.1, the Frobenioid
†Fmod may be thought of as the Frobenioid of arithmetic line bundles on the stack
“Smod” of Remark 3.1.5.
(iv) We continue to use the notation of (iii). We shall denote by a superscript
“birat” the birationalizations [which are category-theoretic — cf. [FrdI], Corollary
4.10; [FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper] of the Frobe-
nioids †F ,
†F ,
†Fmod; we shall also use this superscript to denote the images
of objects and morphisms of these Frobenioids in their birationalizations. Thus, if
A ∈Ob(†F ), then O×(Abirat) may be naturally identified with the multiplicative
group of nonzero elements of the number field [i.e., finite extension of Fmod] cor-
responding to A. In particular, by allowing A to vary among the Frobenius-trivial
objects [a notion which is category-theoretic — cf. [FrdI], Definition 1.2, (iv); [FrdI],
Corollary 4.11, (iv); [FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]
of †F that lie over Galois objects of †D , we obtain a pair [i.e., consisting of a
topological group acting continuously on a discrete abelian group]
π1(†D ) O ×
— which we consider up to the action by the “inner automorphisms of the pair”
arising from conjugation by π1(†D ). Write Φ†F for the divisor monoid of the
Frobenioid †F [which is category-theoretic — cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11, (iii);
[FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]. Thus, for each
p ∈ Prime(Φ†F (A)) [where we use the notation “Prime(−)” as in [FrdI], §0],
the natural homomorphism O×(Abirat) →Φ†F (A)gp [cf. [FrdI], Proposition 4.4,
(iii)] determines — i.e., by taking the inverse image via this homomorphism of
[the union with {0}of] the subset of Φ†F (A) constituted by p — a submonoid

p ⊆O×(Abirat). That is to say, in more intuitive terms, this submonoid is the
submonoid of integral elements of O×(Abirat) with respect to the valuation de-
termined by p of the number field corresponding to A. Write O×
p ⊆O◃
p for the
submonoidofinvertible elements. Thus, byallowingAtovaryamongtheFrobenius-
trivial objects of †F that lie over Galois objects of †D and considering the way
in which the natural action of Aut†F (A) on O×(Abirat) permutes the various sub-
monoids O◃
p , it follows that for each p0 ∈Prime(Φ†F (A0)), where A0 ∈Ob(†F )
lies over a terminal object of †D , we obtain a closed subgroup [well-defined up to
conjugation]
Πp0 ⊆π1(†D )
by considering the elements of Aut†F (A) that fix the submonoid O◃
p , for some
system of p’s lying over p0. That is to say, in more intuitive terms, the subgroup
Πp0 is simply the decomposition group associated to some v ∈Vmod. In particular,
it follows that p0 is nonarchimedean if and only if the p-cohomological dimension
of Πp0 is equal to 2+1 = 3 for infinitely many prime numbers p [cf., e.g., [NSW],
Theorem 7.1.8, (i)].

μZ((−)) def = Hom(Q/Z,(−))
[cf. [AbsTopIII], Definition 3.1, (v); [AbsTopIII], Definition 5.1, (v)]; note that this
notational convention also makes sense if “(−)” is a cyclotomic pseudo-monoid [cf.
§0]. Also, let us write μΘ
Z (π1(†D )) for the cyclotome“μZ(Π(−))” of [AbsTopIII],
Theorem 1.9, which we think of as being applied “via the Θ-approach” [cf. Remark
3.1.2] to π1(†D ). Then let us observe that M

ticular, it follows immediately, by considering divisors of zeroes and poles [cf. the
definition of a “κ-coric function” given in Remark 3.1.7, (i)] associated to Kum-
mer classes of rational functions as in [AbsTopIII], Proposition 1.6, (iii), from the
elementary observation that, relative to the natural inclusion Q →Z⊗Q,

[i.e., of pseudo-monoids equipped with continuous actions by πrat

similar vein, it follows immediately from the theory summarized in [AbsTopIII],
Theorem 1.9, (d), that there exists a unique isomorphism of cyclotomes
μΘ

such that the resulting isomorphism between direct limits of cohomology modules

[i.e., of monoids equipped with continuous actions by π1(†D )] in a fashion that is
compatible with the integral submonoids“O◃
p ” [cf. the discussion of (iv)], relative to
the ring structure constructed in [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, (e), on the domains of
these isomorphisms. In particular, it follows immediately from the above discussion
that
†F alwaysadmitsan∞κ-coric(respectively,∞κ×-coric)structure, which
is, moreover, unique up to a uniquely determined isomorphism [i.e., of
pseudo-monoids equipped with continuous actions by πrat
1 (†D )].
Thus, in the following, we shall regard, without further notice, this uniquely de-
termined ∞κ-coric (respectively,∞κ×-coric) structure on †F as a collection of
data that is naturally associated to †F . Here, we observe that the various iso-
morphisms of the last few displays allow one to regard the pseudo-monoids †M
∞κ,
†M
∞κ× as being related to the Frobenioid †F via †M [cf. the definition of †M

— where we use the superscript “×” to denote the subset of invertible elements

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 129
for the respective “sub-pseudo-monoids” of πrat
1 (†D )-, π
rat/κ-sol
1 (†D )-invariants.
In this context, we observe further that it follows immediately from the discus-
sion of Remark 3.1.7, (i), (ii), (iii) [cf. also [AbsTopII], Corollary 3.3, (iii), which
is applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example 4.8], and the theory summarized in
[AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf., especially, [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, (a), (d), (e)],
that
any ∞κ×-coric structure πrat
1 (†D ) †M
∞κ× on †F determines
an associated ∞κ-coric structure
πrat
1 (†D ) †M
∞κ ⊆ †M
∞κ×
by considering the subset of elements for which the restriction of the as-
sociated Kummer class [as in the above discussion] to some [or, equiva-
lently, every] subgroup of πrat
1 (†D ) that corresponds to an open subgroup
of the decomposition group of some strictly critical point of CFmod
is a torsion element [i.e., corresponds to a root of unity],
and, moreover, that
the operation of restricting Kummer classes [as in the above discus-
sion] arising from †Mκ ⊆ †M
∞κ to subgroups of πκ-sol
1 (†D ) that cor-
respond to decomposition groups of non-critical Fmod-, Fsol-valued
points of CFmod yields a functorial algorithm for reconstructing the
monoids with πκ-sol
1 (†D )-action †Mmod,
†Msol, together with the field
structure — and hence, in particular, the topologies determined by the
valuations — on the union of †Mmod,
†Msol with {0}, from the∞κ-coric
structure associated to †F.
A similar statement to the statement of the last display holds, if one makes the
following substitutions:
“πκ-sol
1 (†D )” “πrat
1 (†D )”;
“Fmod-, Fsol-” “F-”; “†Mmod,
†Msol
” “†M ”.
In particular, we obtain a purely category-theoretic construction, from the category
†F , of the natural bijection
Prime(†Fmod)∼
→ Vmod
— where we write Prime(†Fmod) for the set of primes [cf. [FrdI], §0] of the divisor
monoid of †Fmod; we think of Vmod as the set of π1(†D )-orbits of V(†D ). Now,
in the notation of the discussion of (iv), suppose that p is nonarchimedean [i.e., lies
over a nonarchimedean p0]. Thus, p determines a valuation, hence, in particular, a
topologyonthering{0}∪O×(Abirat). WriteO×
p ,O◃
p fortherespectivecompletions,
with respect to this topology, of the monoids O×
p , O◃
p . Then O◃
p may be identified
with the multiplicative monoid of nonzero integral elements of the completion of the
number field corresponding to A at the prime of this number field determined by
p. Thus, again by allowing A to vary and considering the resulting system of ind-
topological monoids“O◃
p ”, we obtain a construction, for nonarchimedean p0, of the
pair [i.e., consisting of a topological group acting continuously on an ind-topological
monoid]
130 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
Πp0 O◃
p0
— which [since Πp0 is commensurably terminal in π1(†D ) — cf., e.g., [AbsAnab],
Theorem 1.1.1, (i)] we consider up to the action by the “inner automorphisms of
the pair” arising from conjugation by Πp0. In the language of [AbsTopIII], §3, this
pair is an “MLF-Galois TM-pair of strictly Belyi type” [cf. [AbsTopIII], Definition
3.1, (ii); [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.1.3].
(vi) Before proceeding, we observe that the discussion of (iv), (v) concerning
†D may also be carried out for †F ,
†D . We leave the routine details to
†F ,
the reader.
(vii) Next, let us consider the index set J of the capsule of D-prime-strips †DJ.
def
For j ∈J, write Vj
= {vj}v∈V. Thus, we have a natural bijection Vj
∼
→V, i.e.,
given by sending vj →v. These bijections determine a “diagonal subset”
V⟨J⟩ ⊆ VJ
def
=
j∈J
Vj
— which also admits a natural bijection V⟨J⟩
∼
→V. Thus, we obtain natural bijec-
tions
V⟨J⟩

†Fj
def
= {†Fmod,V⟨J⟩
def

∼
→Prime(†Fmod)}
for j ∈J. That is to say, we think of †Fj as a copy of †Fmod “situated on” the
constituent labeled j of the capsule †DJ; we think of †F⟨J⟩ as a copy of †Fmod
“situated in a diagonal fashion on” all the constituents of the capsule †DJ. Thus,
we have a natural embedding of categories
†F⟨J⟩ → †FJ
def
=
j∈J
†Fj
— where, by abuse of notation, we write †F⟨J⟩ for the underlying category of [i.e.,
the first member of the pair] †F⟨J⟩. Here, we remark that we do not regard the
category †FJ as being equipped with a Frobenioid structure. Write
†F R

†F R

for the respective realifications [or product of the underlying categories of the re-
alifications] of the corresponding Frobenioids whose notation does not contain a

discussed in [FrdI], Proposition 5.3.]

Fig. 5.1: Constant distribution
Remark 5.1.1. Thus, †F⟨J⟩ may be thought of as the Frobenioid associated to
divisors on VJ [i.e., finiteformalsumsofelementsofthissetwithcoeﬃcientsinZor
R] whose dependence on j ∈J is constant — that is to say, divisors corresponding
to “constant distributions” on VJ. Such constant distributions are depicted in Fig.
5.1 above. On the other hand, the product of [underlying categories of] Frobenioids
†FJ may be thought of as a sort of category of “arbitrary distributions” on VJ,
i.e., divisors on VJ whose dependence on j ∈J is arbitrary.
Remark 5.1.2. The constructions of Example 5.1 manifestly only require the
D-NF-bridge portion †φNF of the D-ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTD-ΘNF
.
Remark 5.1.3. In the context of the discussion of Example 5.1, (v), (vi), we note
that unlike the case with †F ,
†F ,
†M ,
†Msol,
†M
†M
∞κ,
∞κ×, or †Mκ-sol, one
cannot perform Kummer theory [cf. [FrdII], Definition 2.1, (ii)] with †Fmod,
†Mmod,
or †Mκ . [That is to say, in more concrete terms, [unlike the case with F×
, F×
sol,
or ∞κ-/∞κ×-coric rational functions] it is not necessarily the case that elements of
F×
mod or κ-coric rational functions admit N-th roots, for N a nonnegative integer!]
The fact that one can perform Kummer theory with †F ,
†F , or †M implies that
†M equipped with its natural π1(†D )-action, as well as the “birational monoid
portions” of †F or †F , satisfy various strong rigidity properties [cf. Corollary 5.3,
(i), below]. For instance, these rigidity properties allow one to recover the additive
structure on [the union with {0}of] †M equipped with its natural π1(†D )-action
[cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (v), (vi)]. That is to say,
the additive structure — or, equivalently, ring/field structure — on
[the union with {0}of] the “birational monoid portion” of †Fmod may only
be recovered if one is given the additional datum consisting of the natural
embedding †Fmod →†F [cf. Example 5.1, (iii)].
132 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
Put another way, if one only considers the category †Fmod without the embedding
†Fmod →†F , then †Fmod is subject to a “Kummer black-out” — one con-
sequence of which is that there is no way to recover the additive structure on the
“birational monoid portion” of †Fmod [cf. also Remark 5.1.5 below]. In subsequent
discussions, we shall refer to these observations concerning †F ,
†F ,
†M ,
†Msol,
†M
†M
∞κ,
∞κ×,
†Mκ-sol,
†Fmod,
†Mmod, and †Mκ by saying that †F ,
†F ,
†M ,
†Msol,
†M
†M
∞κ,
∞κ×, and †Mκ-sol are Kummer-ready, whereas †Fmod,
†Mmod,
and †Mκ are Kummer-blind. In particular, the various copies of [and products
of copies of] †Fmod — i.e., †Fj ,
†F⟨J⟩,
†FJ — considered in Example 5.1, (vii),
are also Kummer-blind.
Remark 5.1.4. The various functorial reconstruction algorithms for number
fields discussed in Example 5.1 are based on the technique of Belyi cuspidaliza-
tion, as applied in the theory of [AbsTopIII], §1. At a more concrete level, this
theory of [AbsTopIII], §1, may be thought of revolving around the point of view
that
elements of number fields may be expressed geometrically by means of
Belyi maps.
Moreover, if one thinks of such elements of number fields as “analytic functions”,
then the remainder of the theory of [AbsTopIII] [cf., especially, [AbsTopIII], §5]
may be thought of as a sort of theory of
“analytic continuation” of the “analytic functions” constituted by ele-
ments of number fields in the context of the various logarithm maps
at the various localizations of these number fields.
This point of view is very much in line with the points of view discussed in Re-
marks 4.3.2, 4.3.3. Moreover, the geometric representation of elements of number
fields via Belyi maps [i.e., whose existence may be regarded as a reflection of
the hyperbolic nature of the projective line minus three points] is reminiscent of —
indeed, may perhaps be regarded as an arithmetic analogue of — the “categories
of hyperbolic analytic continuations”, i.e., of copies of the upper half-plane
regarded as equipped with their natural hyperbolic metrics, discussed in the
“Motivating Example” given in the Introduction to [GeoAnbd]. Here, it is perhaps
of interest to note that the inequalities“≤1” satisfied by the derivatives [i.e., with
respect to the respective Poincar´ e metrics] of the holomorphic maps that appear
in this “Motivating Example” in [GeoAnbd] are reminiscent of the monotonically
decreasing nature of the various “degrees” — i.e., over Q of the ramification locus of
the endomorphisms of the projective line over Q — that appear in the construction
of Belyi maps [where we recall that this monotonic decreasing of degrees is the key
observation that allows one to obtain Belyi maps which are unramified over the
projective line minus three points].
Remark 5.1.5. Althoughthephenomenonofκ-sol-conjugate synchronization
discussed in the final portion of Example 5.1, (i), will not play as central a role
in the present series of papers as the conjugate synchronization of local Galois
groupsthatwillbediscussedin[IUTchII],[IUTchIII],ithasthefollowinginteresting

— i.e., of the abstract analogues of “

(v), may be performed in a fashion that is compatible without any
conjugacy indeterminacies with the poly-action of (AutSL(†D ) )
Fl.
Here, we pause, however, to make the following observation: At first glance, it may
appear as though the analogue obtained by Uchida of the Neukirch-Uchida theorem
for maximal solvable quotients of absolute Galois groups of number fields [reviewed,
for instance, in [GlSol], §3] — or, perhaps, some future mono-anabelian version
of this result of Uchida — may be applied, in the context of the“κ-sol-Kummer
theory” just discussed, to reconstruct the ring structure on the number fields
involved [i.e., in the fashion of Example 5.1, (v)]. In fact, however,
such a “solvable-Uchida-type” reconstruction is, in eﬀect, meaning-
less from the point of view of the theory of the present series of papers
since it is fundamentally incompatible with the localization opera-
tions that occur in the structure of a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater — cf. the
discussion of Remarks 4.3.1, 4.3.2.
Indeed, such a compatibility with localization would imply that the reconstruction
of the ring structure may somehow be “restricted” to the absolute Galois groups of
completionsatnonarchimedeanprimesofanumberfield, i.e., incontradictiontothe
well-known fact that absolute Galois groups of such completions at nonarchimedean
primes admit automorphisms that do not arise from field automorphisms [cf., e.g.,
[NSW], the Closing Remark preceding Theorem 12.2.7]. Finally, we note that this
incompatibilityof“solvable-Uchida-type”reconstructionsofringstructureswiththe
theory of the present series of papers is also interesting in the context of the point
of view discussed in Remark 5.1.4: Suppose, for instance, that it was the case that
the outer action of the absolute Galois group of a number field on the geometric fun-
damental group of a hyperbolic curve over the number field in fact factors through
the maximal solvable quotient of the absolute Galois group. Then it is conceivable
that some sort of version of the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII], §1, for ex-
tensions of such a maximal solvable quotient by the geometric fundamental group
under consideration could be applied in the theory of the present series of papers to
give a reconstruction of the ring structure of a number field that only requires the
use of such extensions and is, moreover, compatible with the localization operations
that occur in the various types of “Hodge theaters” that appear in the theory of
the present series of papers — a state of aﬀairs that would be fundamentally at
odds with a quite essential portion of the “spirit” of the theory of the present
series of papers, namely, the point of view of“dismantling the two underlying
combinatorial dimensions of a ring”. In fact, however,
the outer action referred to above does not admit such a “solvable fac-
torization”.
Indeed, the nonexistence of such a “solvable factorization” is a formal consequence
of the the Galois injectivity result discussed in [NodNon], Theorem C — a result
that depends, in an essential way, on the theory of Belyi maps. Put another way,
134 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
Belyi maps not only play the role of allowing one to perform the sort of
“arithmetic analytic continuation via Belyi cuspidalizations”[i.e.,
discussed in Remark 5.1.4] that is of central importance in the theory of
the presentseries of papers, but also play the role of assuring one that such
“arithmetic analytic continuations” cannot be extended to the case of
extensions associated to “solvable factorizations” of outer actions of
the sort just discussed.

(i) We define a holomorphic Frobenioid-prime-strip, or F-prime-strip, [relative
to the given initial Θ-data] to be a collection of data
‡F= {‡Fv}v∈V
that satisfies the following conditions: (a) if v ∈Vnon, then ‡Fv is a category ‡Cv
which admits an equivalence of categories ‡Cv

(iii) A morphism of F- (respectively, F⊢-) prime-strips is defined to be a col-

F -prime-strips is defined to be an isomorphism between collections of data as
discussed above. Following the conventions of §0, one thus has notions of capsules
of F -prime-strips and morphisms of capsules of F -prime-strips.
(v) Let ‡D= {‡Dw}w∈V be a D-prime-strip, v ∈Vnon. Write v ∈Vmod for
the valuation determined by v. Then [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (i); Re-
mark 3.1.7, (i)] one may construct group-theoretically from π1(‡Dv), in a functorial
fashion, a profinite group corresponding to “Cv” [cf. the algorithms of [AbsTopII],
Corollary 3.3, (i), which are applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example 4.8; [Ab-
sTopIII], Theorem 1.9], which contains π1(‡Dv) as an open subgroup; we write ‡Dv
for B(−)0 of this profinite group, so we obtain a natural morphism

is isomorphic [i.e., as an ind-topological monoid equipped with a continuous action
by π1(‡Dv)] to the pair π1(‡Dv) Mv(‡Dv) constructed in (v). One may regard

such a pair π1(‡Dv) ‡Mv as being related to the Frobenioid ‡Fv [cf. (i), (a)]
via the unique isomorphism corresponding to the identity automorphism of ‡D=

π1(‡Dv) ‡Mv
obtained by restricting the action of the pair π1(‡Dv) ‡Mv to the open subgroup
π1(‡Dv) ⊆π1(‡Dv) [cf. (v)]. We shall refer to a pair [i.e., consisting of a pseudo-

diately [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (v)], by considering divisors of zeroes
and poles [cf. the definition of a “κ-coric function” given in Remark 3.1.7, (i)]
associated to Kummer classes of rational functions as in [AbsTopIII], Proposition

such that the resulting isomorphism between direct limits of cohomology modules
induces an isomorphism

[i.e., of monoids equipped with continuous actions by π1(‡Dv)]. In particular, it
follows immediately from the above discussion that
‡Fv always admits an∞κ-coric (respectively,∞κ×-coric) structure, which
is, moreover, unique up to a uniquely determined isomorphism [i.e., of
pseudo-monoids equipped with continuous actions by πrat

Thus, in the following, we shall regard, without further notice, this uniquely deter-
mined ∞κ-coric (respectively,∞κ×-coric) structure on ‡Fv as a collection of data
that is naturally associated to ‡Fv. Here, we observe that the various isomorphisms
of the last few displays allow one to regard the pseudo-monoids ‡M

for the “sub-pseudo-monoid” of πrat

further that it follows immediately from the discussion of Remark 3.1.7, (i), (ii) [cf.
also [AbsTopII], Corollary 3.3, (iii), which is applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Ex-
ample 4.8], and the theory summarized in [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf., especially,

1 (‡Dv) that corre-
spond to decomposition groups of non-critical (Fmod)v-valued points
of Cv yields a functorial algorithm for reconstructing the submonoid
of π1(‡Dv)-invariants of ‡Mgp
v [where the superscript “gp” denotes the
groupification], together with the ind-topological field structure on the
union of this monoid with {0}, from the∞κ-coric structure ‡M

associated to ‡Fv.
A similar statement to the statement of the last display holds, if one replaces the
phrase “(Fmod)v-valued points” by the phrase “Fv-valued points” and the phrase
“submonoid of π1(‡Dv)-invariantsof‡Mgp

(vii) Let ‡D= {‡Dw}w∈V be a D-prime-strip, v ∈Varc. Write v ∈Vmod for the
valuation determined by v. Then [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (i); Remark

— i.e., obtained by considering whether an automorphism of ‡Dv is holomorphic
or anti-holomorphic — from the group of automorphisms of the Aut-holomorphic
orbispace ‡Dv onto the Galois group Gal(Kv/(Fmod)v) . Write
‡Drat
v → ‡Dv
for the projective system of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces that arise as universal
covering spaces of “co-finite” open sub-orbispaces of ‡Dv [i.e., open sub-orbispaces
determined by forming complements of finite sets of points of the underlying topo-
logical orbispace of ‡Dv] that contain every strictly critical point [cf. Remark 3.1.7,
(i)], as well as every point that is not an NF-point [cf. Remark 3.4.3, (ii)], of
‡Dv. Thus, ‡Drat
v is well-defined up to the action of deck transformations over ‡Dv
[cf. the countability of the set of NF-points of ‡Dv; the discussion of compatible
systems of basepoints at the end of Remark 2.5.3, (i)]. Next, let us recall the
complex archimedean topological field A‡Dv [cf. the discussion of Example 3.4, (i),
as well as Definition 3.6, (b); the discussion of (i) of the present Definition 5.2].
Write Aut(A‡Dv) for the group of automorphisms (∼
= Z/2Z) of the topological field
A‡Dv. Observe that it follows immediately from the construction of A‡Dv in [Ab-
sTopIII], Corollary 2.7, (e), that A‡Dv is equipped with a natural Aut-holomorphic
structure [cf. [AbsTopIII], Definition 4.1, (i)], as well as with a tautological co-
holomorphicization [cf. [AbsTopIII], Definition 2.1, (iv); [AbsTopIII], Proposition
2.6, (a)] with ‡Dv. Write
Mv(‡Dv) ⊆ A‡Dv
for the topological submonoid consisting of nonzero elements of norm ≤1 [i.e.,
“O◃
C ”]. Thus, A‡Dv may be identified with the union with {0}of the groupification
Mv(‡Dv)gp. Moreover, the pseudo-monoids of κ-, ∞κ-, and∞κ×-coric rational
functions associated to Cv [cf. the discussion of Remark 3.1.7, (i), (ii)] may be
represented, via algorithmic constructions [cf. [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.7, (b)], as
pseudo-monoids of “meromorphic functions”
Mκv(‡Dv), M
∞κv(‡Dv), M
∞κ×v(‡Dv)
— i.e., as sets of morphisms of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces from [some constituent
of the projective system] ‡Drat
v to Mv(‡Dv)gp that are compatible with the tauto-
logical co-holomorphicization just discussed and, moreover, satisfy conditions corre-
sponding to the conditions of the final display of Remark 3.1.7, (i). Here, Mκv(‡Dv)
may be identified with the subset of elements of M
∞κv(‡Dv) that descend to some
co-finite open sub-orbispace of ‡Dv and, moreover, are equivariant with respect to
theuniqueembeddingAut(‡Dv) →Aut(A‡Dv); [ifweusethesuperscript“×”tode-
note the subset of invertible elements of a pseudo-monoid, then] Mv(‡Dv)× may be

∞κ×v(‡Dv)×; we observe that both Mv(‡Dv)× and M
∞κ×v(‡Dv)×
are isomorphic, as abstract topological monoids, to S1 [i.e., “O×
C ”].
(viii) We continue to use the notation of (vii). Suppose further that ‡F=
{‡Fw}w∈V is an F-prime-strip whose associated D-prime-strip [cf. Remark 5.2.1,
(i), below] is equal to ‡D= {‡Dw}w∈V. Write
‡Mv
140 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
for the topological monoid [i.e., “O◃(‡Cv)” — cf. the discussion of Example 3.4, (i);
Definition 3.6, (b)] that appears as the domain of the Kummer structure portion
of the data that constitutes ‡Fv [cf. (i) of the present Definition 5.2]. Thus, the
Kummer structure portion of ‡Fv may be regarded as an isomorphism of
topological monoids
Mv(‡Dv)∼
→ ‡Mv
[both of which are abstractly isomorphic to O◃
C ]. In particular, the Kummer struc-
ture determines an isomorphism of topological groups Mv(‡Dv)gp ∼
→ ‡Mgp
v [both
of which are abstractly isomorphic to C×], hence also a natural action of Aut(A‡Dv)
on ‡Mgp
v . Next, let us observe that the pseudo-monoid of∞κ- (respectively,∞κ×-)
coric rational functions associated to Cv [cf. the discussion of Remark 3.1.7, (i),
(ii)] may be represented, via algorithmic constructions [cf. [AbsTopIII], Corollary
2.7, (b)], as the pseudo-monoid of “meromorphic functions”
‡M
∞κv (respectively, ‡M
∞κ×v)
by considering the set of maps from [some constituent of the projective system]
‡Drat
v to
‡Mgp
v
that satisfy the following condition: the map from [some constituent of the pro-
jective system] ‡Drat
v to Mv(‡Dv)gp obtained by composing the given map with the
inverse of [the result of applying “gp” to] the Kummer structure isomorphism
Mv(‡Dv)∼
→ ‡Mv determines an element of the pseudo-monoid M
∞κv(‡Dv) (re-
spectively, M
∞κ×v(‡Dv)) discussed in (vii) above. We shall refer to
‡M
∞κv (respectively, ‡M
∞κ×v)
as the [uniquely determined]∞κ-coric (respectively,∞κ×-coric) structure on ‡Fv
and write
‡Mκv ⊆ ‡M
∞κv
for the subset of elements that descend to some co-finite open sub-orbispace of ‡Dv
and, moreover, are equivariant with respect to the unique embedding Aut(‡Dv) →
Aut(A‡Dv). In the following, we shall use the notational convention “μZ((−))”
introduced in Example 5.1, (v). Also, let us write
μΘ
Z (‡Dv) def = Hom(Q/Z,Mv(‡Dv)gp)
= Hom(Q/Z,Mv(‡Dv)μ) = Hom(Q/Z,Mv(‡Dv)×)
— where Mv(‡Dv)× ⊆Mv(‡Dv) denotes the topological group of units of Mv(‡Dv);
Mv(‡Dv)μ ⊆Mv(‡Dv)× denotes the subgroup of torsion elements; we observe that
the Kummer structure isomorphism discussed above induces a natural “Kummer
structure cyclotomic isomorphism” μΘ
Z (‡Dv)∼
→ μZ(‡Mv) [of profinite groups
abstractly isomorphic to Z]; the superscript “Θ” may be thought of as expressing
the fact that we wish to apply to “μΘ
Z (−)” the interpretation via the archimedean
version of the Θ-approach, i.e., the interpretation in terms of cuspidal inertia

cuspidal inertia groups may be interpreted as profinite completions of subgroups of
the group of deck transformations
πrat
1 (‡Dv)
determined, up to inner automorphism, by the projective system of covering spaces
‡Drat
v → ‡Dv. Here, we observe that the pseudo-monoids M
∞κv(‡Dv), ‡M
∞κv
(respectively, M
∞κ×v(‡Dv), ‡M
∞κ×v) admit natural πrat
1 (‡Dv)-actions in such a
way that each of the pairs

∞κv
(respectively, πrat
1 (‡Dv) M
∞κ×v(‡Dv), πrat
1 (‡Dv) ‡M
∞κ×v)
is well-defined up to πrat
1 (‡Dv)-conjugacy. Next, let us observe that by consider-
ing the action of the various cuspidal inertia groups just discussed on elements of
the pseudo-monoid ‡M
∞κv (respectively, ‡M
∞κ×v) — i.e., in eﬀect, by consider-
ing, in the fashion of [AbsTopIII], Proposition 1.6, (iii), “local Kummer classes”
at the points that give rise to these cuspidal inertia groups — we obtain vari-
ous Q-multiples — i.e., corresponding to the order of zeroes or poles at the point
that gives rise to the cuspidal inertia group under consideration — of the Kummer
structure cyclotomic isomorphism μΘ
Z (‡Dv)∼
→ μZ(‡Mv) discussed above. In par-
ticular, relative to the natural identification [cf. the various definitions involved!]
of μZ(‡Mv) with μZ(‡M
∞κv) (respectively, μZ(‡M
∞κ×v)), it follows immediately
[cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (v)], by considering [i.e., in the fashion just dis-
cussed] divisors of zeroes and poles [cf. the definition of a “κ-coric function” given
in Remark 3.1.7, (i)] of meromorphic functions, from the elementary observation
that, relative to the natural inclusion Q →Z⊗Q,
Q>0 Z×

that one may algorithmically reconstruct the Kummer structure cyclotomic
isomorphism
μΘ
Z (‡Dv)∼
→ μZ(‡M

— hence also the Kummer structure isomorphism Mv(‡Dv)μ ∼
→ ‡Mμ
∞κv
(respectively, Mv(‡Dv)μ ∼
→ ‡Mμ
∞κ×v) [where the superscript “μ’s” denote the

Since, moreover, a rational algebraic function is completely determined by its divisor
of zeroes and poles together with its value at a single point, we thus conclude that
one may algorithmically reconstruct the isomorphism(s) of pseudo-monoids

ation of restriction, by the collection of systems of strictly critical
points of ‡Drat
v →‡Dv [i.e., systems of points lying over some strictly
critical point of ‡Dv].
In this context, we observe further that it follows immediately from the discussion
of Remark 3.1.7, (ii) [cf. also [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.7, (b)], that
the ∞κ-coric structure

Remark 5.2.1.
(i) Note that it follows immediately from Definitions 4.1, (i), (iii); 5.2, (i),
(ii); Examples 3.2, (vi), (c), (d); 3.3, (iii), (b), (c), that there exists a functorial
algorithmforconstructingD-(respectively, D⊢-)prime-stripsfromF-(respectively,
F⊢-) prime-strips.
(ii) In a similar vein, it follows immediately from Definition 5.2, (i), (ii); Exam-
ples 3.2, (vi), (f); 3.3, (iii), (e); 3.4, (i), (ii), that there exists a functorial algorithm
for constructing from an F-prime-strip ‡F= {‡Fv}v∈V an F⊢-prime-strip ‡F⊢
‡F → ‡F⊢ = {‡F⊢
v }v∈V
— which we shall refer to as the mono-analyticization of ‡F. Next, let us recall from
the discussion of Example 3.5, (i), the relatively simple structure of the category
“Cmod”, i.e., which may be summarized, roughly speaking, as a collection, indexed
by V∼
→Vmod, of copies of the topological monoid R≥0, which are related to one
anotherbya“productformula”. Inparticular, itfollowsimmediately[cf. Definition
5.2, (i)] from the rigidity of the divisor monoids associated to the Frobenioids that
appear at each of the components at v ∈V of an F-prime-strip [cf., especially,
the topological field structure of the field “ADv” of Example 3.4, (i)!] that one
may also construct from the F-prime-strip ‡F, via a functorial algorithm [cf. the
constructions of Example 3.5, (i), (ii)], a collection of data
‡F → ‡F def = (‡C , Prime(‡C )∼
→V,
‡F⊢
, {‡ρv}v∈V)
— i.e., consisting of a category [which is, in fact, equipped with a Frobenioid
structure], a bijection, the F⊢-prime-strip ‡F⊢, and an isomorphism of topological
monoids associated to ‡C and ‡F⊢, respectively, at each v ∈V — which is iso-
morphic to the collection of data Fmod of Example 3.5, (ii), i.e., which forms an
F -prime-strip [cf. Definition 5.2, (iv)].
Remark 5.2.2. Thus, from the point of view of the discussion of Remark 5.1.3,
F-prime-strips are Kummer-ready [i.e., at v ∈Vnon — cf. the theory of [FrdII], §2],
whereas F⊢-prime-strips are Kummer-blind.
Remark 5.2.3. In the context of the construction of ∞κ-coric structures from
∞κ×-coric structures in Definition 5.2, (vi), we make the following observation.
When v ∈Vbad, it is natural to take the decomposition groups corresponding to
strictly critical points [i.e., to which one restricts the Kummer classes under con-
sideration] to be decomposition groups that correspond to the point of Cv that
arises as the image of the zero-labeled evaluation points [i.e., evaluation points
corresponding to the label 0 ∈|Fl|— cf. the discussion of Example 4.4, (i)]. In the
notation of Example 4.4, (i), this point of Cv may also be described simply as the
point that arises as the image of the point “μ−”.

[cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)] is surjective.
(iv) Let v ∈Vbad. Recall the category F
v of Example 3.2, (i). Thus, F
v
is equipped with a natural Frobenioid structure [cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11;
[EtTh], Proposition 5.1], with base category Dv. Then the natural homomorphism
Aut(F
v) →Aut(Dv) [cf. Example 3.2, (vi), (d)] is bijective.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from the category-theoreticity of the “iso-
morphism M (†D )∼
→ †M ” of Example 5.1, (v) [cf. also the surrounding
discussion; Example 5.1, (vi)]. [Here, we note in passing that this argument is en-
tirely similar tothe techniqueapplied to the proof of the equivalence“ThT∼
→EA ”
of [AbsTopIII], Corollary 5.2, (iv).] Assertion (ii) (respectively, (iii)) follows imme-
diately from [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iv); [AbsTopIII], Proposition 4.2, (i) [cf.
also [AbsTopIII], Remarks 3.1.1, 4.1.1; the discussion of Definition 5.2, (vi), (viii),
of the present paper] (respectively, [AbsTopIII], Proposition 5.8, (ii), (v)).
Finally, we consider assertion (iv). First, we recall that since automorphisms
of Dv = Btemp(X
v)0 necessarily arise from automorphisms of the scheme X
v [cf.
[AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9; [AbsTopIII], Remark 1.9.1], surjectivity follows immedi-
ately from the construction of F
v. Thus, it remains to verify injectivity. To this
end, let α ∈Ker(Aut(F
v) →Aut(Dv)). For simplicity, we suppose [without loss of
generality] that α lies over the identity self-equivalence of Dv. Then I claim that
to show that α is [isomorphic to — cf. §0] the identity self-equivalence of F
v, it
suﬃces to verify that
α induces [cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11; [EtTh], Proposition 5.1] the identity
on the rational function and divisor monoids of F
v.
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 145
Indeed, recall that since F
is a Frobenioid of model type [cf. [EtTh], Definition 3.6,
v
(ii)], it follows from [FrdI], Corollary 5.7, (i), (iv), that α preserves base-Frobenius
pairs. Thus, once one shows that α induces the identity on the rational function
and divisor monoids of F
v, it follows, by arguing as in the construction of the
equivalence of categories given in the proof of [FrdI], Theorem 5.2, (iv), that the
variousunitsobtainedin[FrdI],Proposition5.6, determine[cf. Remark5.3.3below;
the argument of the first paragraph of the proof of [FrdI], Proposition 5.6] an
isomorphism between α and the identity self-equivalence of F
v, as desired.
Thus, we proceed to show that α induces the identity on the rational func-
tion and divisor monoids of F
v, as follows. In light of the category-theoreticity [cf.
[EtTh], Theorem 5.6] of the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism of [EtTh], Proposition
5.5, the fact that α induces the identity on the rational function monoid follows
immediately from the naturality of the Kummer map [cf. the discussion of Remark
3.2.4; [FrdII], Definition 2.1, (ii)], which is injective by [EtTh], Proposition 3.2,
(iii) — cf. the argument of [EtTh], Theorem 5.7, applied to verify the category-
theoreticity of the Frobenioid-theoretic theta function. Next, we consider the eﬀect
ofα onthedivisormonoidofF
v. Tothisend, letusfirstrecallthatα preservescus-
pidal and non-cuspidal elements of the monoids that appear in this divisor monoid
[cf. Remark 3.2.4, (vi); [EtTh], Proposition 5.3, (i)]. In particular, by considering
the non-cuspidal portion of the divisor of the Frobenioid-theoretic theta function
and its conjugates [each of which is preserved by α, since α has already been shown
to induce the identity on the rational function monoid of F
v], we conclude that α
induces the identity on the non-cuspidal elements of the monoids that appear in
the divisor monoid of F
v [cf. [EtTh], Proposition 5.3, (v), (vi), for a discussion
of closely related facts]. In a similar vein, since any divisor of degree zero on an
elliptic curve that is supported on the torsion points of the elliptic curve admits a
positive multiple which is principal, it follows by considering the cuspidal portions
of divisors of appropriate rational functions [each of which is preserved by α, since
α has already been shown to induce the identity on the rational function monoid of
F
v] that α also induces the identity on the cuspidal elements of the monoids that
appear in the divisor monoid of F
v. This completes the proof of assertion (iv). ⃝
Remark 5.3.1.
(i) In the situation of Corollary 5.3, (ii), let
φ : 1D →2D
be a morphism of D-prime-strips [i.e., which is not necessarily an isomorphism!]
that induces an isomorphism between the respective collections of data indexed by
v ∈Vgood, as well as an isomorphism φ⊢ : 1D⊢ ∼
→2D⊢ between the associated
D⊢-prime-strips [cf. Definition 4.1, (iv)]. Then let us observe that by applying
Corollary 5.3, (ii), it follows that φ lifts to a uniquely determined “arrow”
ψ : 1F →2F
— which we think of as “lying over” φ — defined as follows: First, let us recall
that, in light of our assumptions on φ, it follows immediately from the construction
146 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
[cf. Examples 3.2, (iii); 3.3, (i); 3.4, (i)] of the various p-adic and archimedean
Frobenioids [cf. [FrdII], Example 1.1, (ii); [FrdII], Example 3.3, (ii)] that appear
in an F-prime-strip that it makes sense to speak of the “pull-back” — i.e., by
forming the “categorical fiber product” [cf. [FrdI], §0; [FrdI], Proposition 1.6] —
of the Frobenioids that appear in the F-prime-strip 2F via the various morphisms
at v ∈V that constitute φ. That is to say, it follows from our assumptions on
φ [cf. also [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iv)] that φ determines a pulled-back F-
prime-strip“φ∗(2F)”, whose associated D-prime-strip [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)] is
tautologically equal to 1D. On the other hand, by Corollary 5.3, (ii), it follows
that this tautological equality of associated D-prime-strips uniquely determines an
isomorphism 1F∼
→φ∗(2F). Then we define the arrow ψ : 1F → 2F to be the
collection of data consisting of φ and this isomorphism 1F∼
→φ∗(2F); we refer to ψ
as the “morphism uniquely determined by φ” or the “uniquely determined morphism
that lies over φ”. Also, we shall apply various terms used to describe a morphism
φ of D-prime-strips to the “arrow” of F-prime-strips determined by φ.
(ii) The conventions discussed in (i) concerning liftings of morphisms of D-
prime-strips may also be applied to poly-morphisms. We leave the routine details
to the reader.
Remark 5.3.2. Just as in the case of Corollary 5.3, (i), (ii), the rigidity property
of Corollary 5.3, (iv), may be regarded as being essentially a consequence of the
“Kummer-readiness” [cf. Remarks 5.1.3, 5.2.2] of the tempered Frobenioid F
—
v
cf. also the arguments applied in the proofs of [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iv);
[AbsTopIII], Corollary 5.2, (iv).
Remark 5.3.3. We take this opportunity to rectify a minor oversight in [FrdI].
The hypothesis that the Frobenioids under consideration be of “unit-profinite type”
in [FrdI], Proposition 5.6 — hence also in [FrdI], Corollary 5.7, (iii) — may be
removed. Indeed, if, in the notation of the proof of [FrdI], Proposition 5.6, one
writes φ′
p
= cp·φp, where cp ∈O×(A), for p ∈Primes, then one has
c2·c2
p·φ2·φp = c2·φ2·cp·φp = φ′
2·φ′
p
= φ′
p·φ′
2
= cp·φp·c2·φ2 = cp·cp
2·φp·φ2 = cp·cp
2·φ2·φp
— so c2·c2
p
= cp·cp
2, i.e., cp = cp−1
2 , for p ∈Primes. Thus, φ′
= c−1
p
2·φp·c2, so by
def
taking u
= c−1
2 , one may eliminate the final two paragraphs of the proof of [FrdI],
Proposition 5.6.
Let
†HTΘ = ({†F
v}v∈V,
†Fmod)
be a Θ-Hodge theater [relative to the given initial Θ-data — cf. Definition 3.6] such
that the associated D-prime-strip {†Dv}v∈V is [for simplicity] equal to the D-prime-
strip †D> of the D-ΘNF-Hodge theater in the discussion preceding Example 5.1.

“{†F
v}v∈V” of Definition 3.6; Definition 5.2, (i); Example 3.2, (iii); Example 3.3,
(i)]. Thus, †D> may be identified with the D-prime-strip associated [cf. Remark
5.2.1, (i)] to †F>.
Example 5.4. Model Θ- and NF-Bridges.
(i) For j ∈J, let
†Fj= {†Fvj }vj∈Vj
be an F-prime-strip whose associated D-prime-strip [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)] is equal
to †Dj,
†F⟨J⟩= {†Fv⟨J⟩}v⟨J⟩∈V⟨J⟩
an F-prime-strip whose associated D-prime-strip we denote by †D⟨J⟩ [cf. Example
5.1, (vii)]. Write
†FJ
def
=
†Fj
j∈J
— where the “formal product ” is to be understood as denoting the capsule with
index set J for which the datum indexed by j is given by †Fj. Thus, †F⟨J⟩ may be
related to †F>, in a natural fashion, via the full poly-isomorphism
†F⟨J⟩
∼
→ †F>
and to †FJ via the “diagonal arrow”
†F⟨J⟩ → †FJ =
j∈J
— i.e., the arrow defined as the collection of data indexed by J for which the
datum indexed by j is given by the full poly-isomorphism †F⟨J⟩
∼
→†Fj. Thus, we
think of †Fj as a copy of †F> “situated on” the constituent labeled j of the capsule
†DJ; we think of †F⟨J⟩ as a copy of †F> “situated in a diagonal fashion on” all the
constituents of the capsule †DJ.
(ii) Note that in addition to thinking of †F> as being related to †Fj [for j ∈J]
via the full poly-isomorphism †F>
∼
→†Fj, we may also regard †F> as being related
to †Fj [for j ∈J] via the poly-morphism
†ψΘ
j : †Fj →†F>
uniquely determined by †φΘ
j [i.e., as discussed in Remark 5.3.1]. Write
†ψΘ : †FJ →†F>
for the collection of arrows {†ψΘ
j }j∈J — which we think of as “lying over” the
collection of arrows †φΘ = {†φΘ
j }j∈J.
(iii) Next, let †F ,
†F be as in Example 5.1, (iii); δ ∈LabCusp(†D ). Thus,
[cf. the discussion of Example 4.3, (i)] there exists a unique Autϵ(†D )-orbit of
†Fj
148 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
isomorphisms †D∼ →D that maps δ →[ϵ] ∈LabCusp(D ). We shall refer to
as a δ-valuation ∈V(†D ) [cf. Definition 4.1, (v)] any element that maps to an
element of V±un [cf. Example 4.3, (i)] via this Autϵ(†D )-orbit of isomorphisms.
Note that the notion of a δ-valuation may also be defined intrinsically by means
of the structure of D-NF-bridge †φNF. Indeed, [one verifies immediately that] a
δ-valuation may be defined as a valuation ∈V(†D ) that lies in the “image” [in
the evident sense] via †φNF of the unique D-prime-strip †Dj of the capsule †DJ
such that the bijection LabCusp(†D )∼
→LabCusp(†Dj) induced by †φNF [cf. the
discussion of Example 4.5, (i)] maps δ to the element of LabCusp(†Dj) that is
“labeled 1”, relative to the bijection of the second display of Proposition 4.2.
(iv) We continue to use the notation of (iii). Then let us observe that by
localizing at each of the δ-valuations ∈V(†D ), one may construct, in a natural
way, an F-prime-strip
†F |δ
— which is well-defined up to isomorphism — from †F [i.e., in the notation of
Example 5.1, (iv), from O ×, equipped with its natural π1(†D )-action]. Indeed,
at a nonarchimedean δ-valuation v, this follows by considering the pv-adic Frobe-
nioids [cf. Remark 3.3.2] associated to the restrictions to suitable open subgroups
of Πp0 π1(†D ) (⊆π1(†D ) ⊆π1(†D )) determined by δ ∈LabCusp(†D ) [i.e.,
open subgroups corresponding to the coverings “X”, “X
− →” discussed in Definition
3.1, (e), (f); cf. also Remark 3.1.2, (i)], where Πp0 is chosen [among its π1(†D )-
conjugates] so as to correspond to v, of the pairs
“Πp0 O◃
”
p0
of Example 5.1, (v) [cf. also Example 5.1, (vi)]. [Here, we note that, when v
lies over an element of Vbad
mod, one must replace these “suitable open subgroups” by
their tempered analogues, i.e., by applying the mono-anabelian algorithm implicit
in the proof of [SemiAnbd], Theorem 6.6.] On the other hand, at an archimedean δ-
valuation v, this follows by applying the functorial algorithm for reconstructing the
corresponding Aut-holomorphic orbispace at v given in [AbsTopIII], Corollaries 2.8,
2.9, together with the discussion concerning the “isomorphism M (†D )∼
→ †M ”
in Example 5.1, (v) [cf. also Example 5.1, (vi)]. Here, we observe that since
the natural projection map V±un →Vmod fails to be injective, in order to relate
the restrictions obtained at diﬀerent elements in a fiber of this map in a well-
defined fashion, it is necessary to regard †F |δ as being well-defined only up to
isomorphism. Nevertheless, despite this indeterminacy inherent in the definition
of †F |δ, it still makes sense to define, for an F-prime-strip ‡F with underlying
D-prime-strip ‡D [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)], a poly-morphism
‡F →†F
to be a full poly-isomorphism ‡F∼
→†F |δ for some δ ∈LabCusp(†D ) [cf. Def-
inition 4.1, (vi)]. Moreover, it makes sense to pre-compose such poly-morphisms
with isomorphisms of F-prime-strips and to post-compose such poly-morphisms
with isomorphisms between isomorphs of †F . Here, we note that such a poly-
morphism ‡F →†F may be thought of as “lying over” an induced poly-morphism
‡D →†D [cf. Definition 4.1, (vi)], and that any poly-morphism ‡F →†F is
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 149
fixed by pre-composition with automorphisms of ‡F, as well as by post-composition
with automorphisms ∈Autϵ(†F ). Also, we observe that such a poly-morphism
‡F →†F is compatible with the local and global∞κ-coric structures [cf. Ex-
ample 5.1, (v); Definition 5.2, (vi), (viii)] that appear in the domain and codomain
of this poly-morphism in the following sense: the operation of restriction of associ-
ated Kummer classes [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (v); Definition 5.2, (vi),
(viii); the constructions discussed in the present item (iv)] determines a collection,
indexed by v ∈V, of poly-morphisms of pseudo-monoids
πrat
1 (†D ) †M
∞κ → ‡M
∞κv ⊆ ‡M
∞κ×v
v∈V
—where the global data in the domain of the arrow that appears in the displayis re-
garded as only beingdefined up toautomorphisms induced byinner automorphisms
of πrat
1 (†D ) [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (i)]; the local data in the codomain
of the arrow that appears in the display is regarded as only being defined up to au-
tomorphisms induced by automorphisms of the F-prime-strip ‡F [cf. Definition 5.2,
(vi), (viii); Corollary 5.3, (ii)]; the arrow of the display is equivariant with respect to
the various homomorphisms πrat
1 (‡Dv) →πrat
1 (†D ) [i.e., relative to the respective
actions of these groups on the pseudo-monoids in the domain and codomain of the
arrow] induced [cf. the constructions discussed in the present item (iv), as well as
the theory summarized in [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, and [AbsTopIII], Corollaries
1.10, 2.8] by the given poly-morphism ‡F →†F ; when v ∈Varc, we regard the
pseudo-monoids ‡M
∞κv ⊆ ‡M
∞κ×v as being equipped with the various splittings
discussed in Definition 5.2, (viii). Finally, if {eF}e∈E is a capsule of F-prime-strips
whose associated capsule of D-prime-strips [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)] we denote by
{eD}e∈E, then we define a poly-morphism
{eF}e∈E →†F (respectively, {eF}e∈E →†F)
to be a collection of poly-morphisms {eF →†F }e∈E (respectively, {eF →†F}e∈E)
[cf. Definition 4.1, (vi)]. Thus, a poly-morphism {eF}e∈E →†F (respectively,
{eF}e∈E → †F) may be thought of as “lying over” an induced poly-morphism
{eD}e∈E →†D (respectively, {eD}e∈E →†D) [cf. Definition 4.1, (vi)].
(v) We continue to use the notation of (iv). Now observe that by Corollary
5.3, (ii), there exists a unique poly-morphism
†ψNF : †FJ →†F
that lies over †φNF
.
(vi)Wecontinuetousethenotationof(v). Nowobservethatitfollowsfromthe
definition of †Fmod in terms of terminal objects of †D [cf. Example 5.1, (iii)] that
any poly-morphism †F⟨J⟩ →†F [cf. the notation of (i)] induces, via “restriction”
[in the evident sense], an isomorphism class of functors [cf. Definition 5.2, (i); the
notation of Example 5.1, (vii)]
(†F →†F ⊇) †Fmod

150 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
for each v⟨J⟩ ∈V⟨J⟩ — where, by abuse of notation when v⟨J⟩ ∈Varc
⟨J⟩, we write
“†Fv⟨J⟩
” for the category portion of the “collection of data” that appears in Def-
inition 5.2, (i), (b) — which is independent of the choice of the poly-morphism
†F⟨J⟩ →†F [i.e., among its Fl -conjugates]. That is to say, the fact that †Fmod
is defined in terms of terminal objects of †D [cf. also the definition of Fmod given
in Definition 3.1, (b)!] implies that this particular isomorphism class of functors is
immune to [i.e., fixed by] the various indeterminacies that appear in the choice of
†F⟨J⟩ →†F . Let us write
(†F →†F ⊇) †Fmod
∼
→†F⟨J⟩ → †F⟨J⟩
for the collection of isomorphism classes of restriction functors just defined, as v⟨J⟩
ranges over the elements of V⟨J⟩. In a similar vein, we also obtain collections of
natural isomorphism classes of restriction functors
†FJ → †FJ; †Fj → †Fj
for j ∈J. Finally, just as in Example 5.1, (vii), we obtain natural realifications

classes of restriction functors discussed so far.

Remark 5.4.1. The constructions of Example 5.4, (i), (ii) (respectively, Example
5.4, (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii)) manifestly only require the D-Θ-bridge portion †φΘ
(respectively, D-NF-bridge portion †φNF) of the D-ΘNF-Hodge theater †HTD-ΘNF
[cf. Remark 5.1.2].
Remark 5.4.2.
(i) At this point, it is useful to consider the various copies of †Fmod and its re-
alifications introduced so far from the point of view of “log-volumes”, i.e., arith-
metic degrees [cf., e.g., the discussion of [FrdI], Example 6.3; [FrdI], Theorem 6.4;
Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]. That is to say, since †Fj may be thought of as
a sort of “section of †FJ over †Fmod
” — i.e., a sort of “section of K over Fmod
” [cf.
the discussion of prime-strips in Remark 4.3.1] — one way to think of log-volumes
of †F⟨J⟩ is as quantities that diﬀer by a factor of l — i.e., corresponding, to the
cardinality of J∼
→Fl — from log-volumes of †Fj . Put another way, this amounts
to thinking of arithmetic degrees that appear in the various factors of †FJ as being
averaged over the elements of J and hence of arithmetic degrees that
appear in †F⟨J⟩ as the “resulting averages”.
This sort of averaging may be thought of as a sort of abstract, Frobenioid-theoretic
analogue of the normalization of arithmetic degrees that is often used in the theory
of heights [cf., e.g., [GenEll], Definition 1.2, (i)] that allows one to work with heights
in such a way that the height of a point remains invariant with respect to change
of the base field.
(ii) On the other hand, to work with the various isomorphisms of Frobenioids
— such as †Fj
∼
→†F⟨J⟩ — involved amounts [since the arithmetic degree is an
intrinsic invariant of the Frobenioids involved — cf. [FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (iv);
Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper] to thinking of arithmetic degrees that appear
in the various factors of †FJ as being
summed [i.e., without dividing by a factor of l ] over the elements of J
and hence of arithmetic degrees that appear in †F⟨J⟩ as the “resulting
sums”.
This point of view may be thought of as a sort of abstract, Frobenioid-theoretic
analogue of the normalization of arithmetic degrees or heights in which the height
of a point is multiplied by the degree of the field extension when one executes a
change of the base field.
The notions defined in the following “Frobenioid-theoretic lifting” of Definition
4.6 will play a central role in the theory of the present series of papers.
Definition 5.5.
(i) We define an NF-bridge [relative to the given initial Θ-data] to be a collec-
tion of data
(‡FJ
‡ψNF
−→ ‡F ‡F )
152 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
as follows:
(a) ‡FJ = {‡Fj}j∈J is a capsule of F-prime-strips, indexed by a finite index
set J. Write ‡DJ = {‡Dj}j∈J for the associated capsule of D-prime-strips
[cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)].
(b) ‡F ,
‡F are categories equivalent to the categories †F ,
†F , respec-
tively, of Example 5.1, (iii). Thus, each of ‡F ,
‡F is equipped with
a natural Frobenioid structure [cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11; [FrdI], Theo-
rem 6.4, (i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]; write ‡D ,
‡D for the
respective base categories of these Frobenioids.
(c) The arrow “ ” consists of the datum of a morphism ‡D →‡D
which is abstractly equivalent [cf. §0] to the natural morphism †D →
†D of Example 5.1, (i), together with the datum of an isomorphism
‡F∼
→‡F |‡D [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (iii)].
(d) ‡ψNF is a poly-morphism that lifts [uniquely! — cf. Corollary 5.3, (ii)] a
poly-morphism ‡φNF : ‡DJ →‡D such that ‡φNF forms a D-NF-bridge
[cf. Example 5.4, (v); Remark 5.4.1].
Thus, one verifies immediately that any NF-bridge as above determines an as-
sociated D-NF-bridge (‡φNF : ‡DJ → ‡D ). We define a(n) [iso]morphism of
NF-bridges
(1FJ1
1ψNF
−→ 1F 1F ) → (2FJ2
2ψNF
−→ 2F 2F )
to be a collection of arrows
1FJ1
∼
→2FJ2; 1F∼
→2F ; 1F∼
→2F
— where 1FJ1
∼
→2FJ2 is a capsule-full poly-isomorphism [cf. §0], hence induces a
poly-isomorphism 1DJ1
∼
→2DJ2; 1F∼
→2F is a poly-isomorphism which lifts
a poly-isomorphism 1D∼
→ 2D such that the pair of arrows 1DJ1
∼
→ 2DJ2,
1D∼
→2D forms a morphism between the associated D-NF-bridges; 1F∼
→2F
is an isomorphism — which are compatible [in the evident sense] with the iψNF [for
i = 1,2], as well as with the respective “ ’s”. It is immediate that any morphism
of NF-bridges induces a morphism between the associated D-NF-bridges. There is
an evident notion of composition of morphisms of NF-bridges.
(ii) We define a Θ-bridge [relative to the given initial Θ-data] to be a collection
of data
(‡FJ
‡ψΘ
−→ ‡F>
‡HTΘ)
as follows:
(a) ‡FJ = {‡Fj}j∈J is a capsule of F-prime-strips, indexed by a finite index
set J. Write ‡DJ = {‡Dj}j∈J for the associated capsule of D-prime-strips
[cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)].
(b) ‡HTΘ is a Θ-Hodge theater.
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 153
(c) ‡F> is the F-prime-strip tautologically associated to ‡HTΘ [cf. the
discussion preceding Example 5.4]; we use the notation “ ” to denote
this relationship between ‡F> and ‡HTΘ. Write ‡D> for the D-prime-
strip associated to ‡F> [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)].
(d) ‡ψΘ = {‡ψΘ
j }j∈J is the collection of poly-morphisms ‡ψΘ
j : ‡Fj →‡F>
determined [i.e., as discussed in Remark 5.3.1] by a D-Θ-bridge ‡φΘ =
{‡φΘ
j : ‡Dj →‡D>}j∈J.
Thus, one verifies immediately that any Θ-bridge as above determines an associated

the full poly-isomorphism; 1HTΘ∼
→2HTΘ is an isomorphism of Θ-Hodge theaters
[cf. Remark 3.6.2] — which are compatible [in the evident sense] with the iψΘ [for
i = 1,2], as well as with the respective “ ’s” [cf. Corollary 5.6, (i), below]. It
is immediate that any morphism of Θ-bridges induces a morphism between the
associated D-Θ-bridges. There is an evident notion of composition of morphisms
of Θ-bridges.
(iii) We define a ΘNF-Hodge theater [relative to the given initial Θ-data] to be
a collection of data
‡HTΘNF = (‡F ‡F

— where the data (‡F ‡F ←− ‡FJ) forms an NF-bridge; the data
(‡FJ −→ ‡F> ‡HTΘ) forms a Θ-bridge — such that the associated data
{‡φNF
,
‡φΘ}[cf. (i), (ii)] forms a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater. A(n) [iso]morphism of
ΘNF-Hodge theaters is defined to be a pair of morphisms between the respective
associatedNF-andΘ-bridgesthatarecompatiblewithoneanotherinthesensethat
they induce the same bijection between the index sets of the respective capsules of
F-prime-strips. There is an evident notion of composition of morphisms of ΘNF-
Hodge theaters.
Corollary 5.6. (Isomorphisms of Θ-Hodge Theaters, NF-Bridges, Θ-
Bridges, and ΘNF-Hodge Theaters) Relative to a fixed collection of initial
Θ-data:
(i) The natural functorially induced map from the set of isomorphisms be-
tween two Θ-Hodge theaters to the set of isomorphisms between the respective
associated D-prime-strips [cf. the discussion preceding Example 5.4; Remark
5.2.1, (i)] is bijective.
(ii) The natural functorially induced map from the set of isomorphisms be-
tween two NF-bridges (respectively, two Θ-bridges; two ΘNF-Hodge the-
aters) to the set of isomorphisms between the respective associated D-NF-bridges
154 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
(respectively, associated D-Θ-bridges; associated D-ΘNF-Hodge theaters) is
bijective.
(iii) Given an NF-bridge and a Θ-bridge, the set of capsule-full poly-isomorphisms
between the respective capsules of F-prime-strips which allow one to glue the given
NF- and Θ-bridges together to form a ΘNF-Hodge theater forms an Fl -torsor.
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). Sorting through the data listed in the
definition of a Θ-Hodge theater †HTΘ [cf. Definition 3.6], one verifies immediately
that the only data that is not contained in the associated F-prime-strip †F> [cf.
the discussion preceding Example 5.4] is the global data of Definition 3.6, (c), and
the tempered Frobenioids isomorphic to “F
v” [cf. Example 3.2, (i)] at the v ∈Vbad
.
That is to say, for v ∈Vgood, one verifies immediately that
†F>,v = †F
v
[cf. Example 3.3, (i); Example 3.4, (i); Definition 3.6; Definition 5.2, (i)]. On
the other hand, one verifies immediately that this global data may be obtained
by applying the functorial algorithm “‡F → ‡F ” summarized in the second
display of Remark 5.2.1, (ii), to the associated F-prime-strips that appear. Thus,
assertion (i) follows by applying Corollary 5.3, (ii), to the associated F-prime-
strips and Corollary 5.3, (iv), to the various tempered Frobenioids at v ∈Vbad
.
This completes the proof of assertion (i). In light of assertion (i), assertions (ii),
(iii) follow immediately from the definitions and Corollary 5.3, (i), (ii) [cf. also
Proposition 4.8, (iii), in the case of assertion (iii)]. ⃝
Remark 5.6.1. Observe that the various “functorial dynamics” studied in
§4 — i.e., more precisely, analogues of Propositions 4.8, (i), (ii); 4.9; 4.11 — apply
to the NF-bridges, Θ-bridges, and ΘNF-Hodge theaters studied in the present §5.
Indeed, such analogues follow immediately from Corollaries 5.3, (ii), (iii); 5.6, (ii).

Section 6: Additive Combinatorial Teichm¨ uller Theory
In the present §6, we discuss the additive analogue — i.e., which revolves
around the “functorial dynamics” that arise from labels
∈Fl
— of the “multiplicative combinatorial Teichm¨ uller theory” developed in §4 for
labels ∈Fl . These considerations lead naturally to certain enhancements of the
variousHodge theatersconsideredin§5. Ontheotherhand, despitetheresemblance
of the theory of the present §6 to the theory of §4, §5, the theory of the present
§6 is, in certain respects — especially those respects that form the analogue of the
theory of §5 — substantially technically simpler.
In the following, we fix a collection of initial Θ-data
(F/F, XF, l, CK, V, Vbad
mod, ϵ)
as in Definition 3.1; also, we shall use the various notations introduced in Definition
3.1 for various objects associated to this initial Θ-data.
Definition 6.1.
(i) We shall write
F ±
l
def
= Fl {±1}
for the group determined by forming the semi-direct product with respect to the
natural inclusion {±1} →F×
l and refer to an element of F ±
l that maps to +1
(respectively,−1) via the natural surjection F ±
l {±1}as positive (respectively,
negative). We shall refer to as an F±
l -group any set E equipped with a {±1}-orbit
of bijections E∼
→Fl. Thus, any F±
l -group E is equipped with a natural Fl-module
structure. We shall refer to as an F±
l -torsor any set T equipped with an F ±
l -orbit
of bijections T∼
→Fl [relative to the action of F ±
l on Fl by automorphisms of
the form Fl ∋z →±z +λ ∈Fl, for λ ∈Fl]. Thus, if T is an F±
l -torsor, then the
abeliangroupofautomorphismsoftheunderlying setof Fl givenbythetranslations
Fl ∋z →z +λ ∈Fl, for λ ∈Fl, determines an abelian group
Aut+(T)
of “positive automorphisms” of the underlying set of T. Moreover, Aut+(T) is
equipped with a natural structure of F±
l -group [such that the abelian group struc-
ture of Aut+(T) coincides with the Fl-module structure of Aut+(T) induced by this
F±
l -group structure]. Finally, if T is an F±
l -torsor, then we shall write
Aut±(T)
for the group of automorphisms of the underlying set of T determined [relative to
the F±
l -torsor structure on T] by the group of automorphisms of the underlying set
of Fl given by F ±
l [so Aut+(T) ⊆Aut±(T) is the unique subgroup of index 2].

(ii) Let
†D= {†Dv}v∈V
be a D-prime-strip [relative to the given initial Θ-data]. Observe [cf. the discussion
of Definition 4.1, (i)] that if v ∈Vnon, then π1(†Dv) determines, in a functorial
fashion, a topological [in fact, profinite if v ∈Vgood] group corresponding to “Xv
”
[cf. Corollary 1.2 if v ∈Vgood; [EtTh], Proposition 2.4, if v ∈Vbad], which contains
π1(†Dv) as an open subgroup; thus, if we write †D±
v for B(−)0 of this topological
group, then we obtain a natural morphism †Dv →†D±
v [cf. §0]. In a similar vein, if
v ∈Varc, then since X
− →v
admits a Kv-core, a routine translation into the “language
of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces” of the argument given in the proof of Corollary 1.2
[cf. also [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.4] reveals that †Dv determines, in a functorial
fashion, an Aut-holomorphic orbispace †D±
v corresponding to “Xv”, together with
a natural morphism †Dv →†D±
v of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces. Thus, in summary,
one obtains a collection of data
†D±
= {†D±
v }v∈V
completely determined by †D.
(iii) Suppose that we are in the situation of (ii). Then observe [cf. the dis-
cussion of Definition 4.1, (ii)] that by applying the group-theoretic algorithm of
[AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5 [cf. also Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper], to the
topological group π1(†Dv) when v ∈Vnon, or by considering π0(−) of a cofinal
collection of “neighborhoods of infinity” [i.e., complements of compact subsets] of
the underlying topological space of †Dv when v ∈Varc, it makes sense to speak of
the set of cusps of †Dv; a similar observation applies to †D±
v , for v ∈V. If v ∈V,
then we define a ±-label class of cusps of †Dv to be the set of cusps of †Dv that lie
over a single cusp [i.e., corresponding to an arbitrary element of the quotient “Q”
that appears in the definition of a “hyperbolic orbicurve of type (1,l-tors)” given
in [EtTh], Definition 2.1] of †D±
v ; write
LabCusp±(†Dv)
for the set of ±-label classes of cusps of †Dv. Thus, [for any v ∈V!] LabCusp±(†Dv)
admits a natural action by F×
l [cf. [EtTh], Definition 2.1], as well as a zero element
†η0
∈LabCusp±(†Dv)
v
and a ±-canonical element
†η±
∈LabCusp±(†Dv)
v
— which is well-defined up to multiplication by ±1, and which may be constructed
solely from †Dv [cf. Definition 4.1, (ii)] — such that, relative to the natural bijection
LabCusp±(†Dv)\{†η0
v} /{±1}∼
→LabCusp(†Dv)
[cf. the notation of Definition 4.1, (ii)], we have †η±
v
→†ηv. In particular, we
obtain a natural bijection
LabCusp±(†Dv)∼

— which is well-defined up to multiplication by ±1 and compatible, relative to the
natural bijection to “LabCusp(−)” of the preceding display, with the natural bijec-
tion of the second display of Proposition 4.2. That is to say, in the terminology of
(i), LabCusp±(†Dv) is equipped with a natural F±
l -group structure. This F±
l -group
structure determines a natural surjection
Aut(†Dv) {±1}
— i.e., by considering the induced automorphism of LabCusp±(†Dv). Write
Aut+(†Dv) ⊆Aut(†Dv)
fortheindextwosubgroupof“positive automorphisms”[i.e., thekerneloftheabove
surjection] and Aut−(†Dv) def = Aut(†Dv) \Aut+(†Dv) [i.e., where “\” denotes the
set-theoretic complement] for the subset of “negative automorphisms”. In a similar
vein, we shall write
Aut+(†D) ⊆Aut(†D)
for the subgroup of “positive automorphisms” [i.e., automorphisms each of whose
components, for v ∈V, is positive], and, if α ∈{±1}V [i.e., where we write {±1}V
for the set of set-theoretic maps from V to {±1}],
Autα(†D) ⊆Aut(†D)
for the subset of “α-signed automorphisms” [i.e., automorphisms each of whose
components, for v ∈V, is positive if α(v) = +1 and negative if α(v) =−1].
(iv) Suppose that we are in the situation of (ii). Let
‡D= {‡Dv}v∈V
be another D-prime-strip [relative to the given initial Θ-data]. Then for any v ∈V,
we shall refer to as a +-full poly-isomorphism †Dv
∼
→‡Dv any poly-isomorphism
obtained as the Aut+(†Dv)- [or, equivalently, Aut+(‡Dv)-] orbit of an isomorphism
†Dv
∼

isomorphisms †Dv
∼
→‡Dv, namely, the +-full poly-isomorphism determined by the
identity isomorphism, which we shall refer to as positive, and the unique non-
positive +-full poly-isomorphism, which we shall refer to as negative. In a similar

→‡D any poly-isomorphism

with the set {±1}V; we shall refer to the +-full poly-isomorphism †D∼

corresponds to α ∈ {±1}V as the α-signed +-full poly-isomorphism. Finally, a

(v) Write
D ± def
= B(XK)0
[cf. §0; the situation discussed in Definition 4.1, (v)]. Thus, we have a finite ´ etale
double covering D ± →D= B(CK)0. Just as in the case of D [cf. Example
4.3, (i)], one may construct, in a category-theoretic fashion from D ±, the outer
homomorphism
Aut(D ±) →GL2(Fl)/{±1}
arising from the l-torsion points of the elliptic curve EF [i.e., from the Galois ac-
tion on Δab
X ⊗Fl]. Moreover, it follows from the construction of XK that, relative
to the natural isomorphism Aut(D ±)∼
→Aut(XK) [cf., e.g., [AbsTopIII], Theo-
rem 1.9], the image of the above outer homomorphism is equal to a subgroup of
GL2(Fl)/{±1}that contains a Borel subgroup of SL2(Fl)/{±1}[cf. the discussion
of Example 4.3, (i)] — i.e., the Borel subgroup corresponding to the rank one quo-
tient of Δab
X ⊗Fl that gives rise to the covering XK →XK. In particular, this rank
one quotient determines a natural surjective homomorphism
Aut(D ±) Fl
[which may be reconstructed category-theoretically from D ±!] — whose kernel
we denote by Aut±(D ±) ⊆Aut(D ±). One verifies immediately that the sub-
group Aut±(D ±) ⊆Aut(D ±)∼
→Aut(XK) contains the subgroup AutK(XK) ⊆
Aut(XK) of K-linear automorphisms and acts transitively on the cusps of XK.
Next, let us write Autcsp(D ±) ⊆Aut±(D ±) for the subgroup [which may be re-
constructed category-theoretically from D ±! — cf. [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, as well
as Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper] of automorphisms that fix the cusps of
XK. Then one obtains natural outer isomorphisms
AutK(XK)∼

→ F ±
l
[cf. the discussion preceding [EtTh], Definition 2.1] — where the second outer
isomorphism depends, in an essential way, on the choice of the cusp ϵ of CK [cf.
Definition 3.1, (f)]. Put another way, if we write Aut+(D ±) ⊆Aut±(D ±) for the
unique index two subgroup containing Autcsp(D ±), then the cusp ϵ determines a
natural F±
l -group structure on the subgroup
Aut+(D ±)/Autcsp(D ±) ⊆ Aut±(D ±)/Autcsp(D ±)
[which corresponds to the subgroup Gal(XK/XK) ⊆AutK(XK) via the natural
outer isomorphisms of the preceding display] and, in the notation of (vi) below, a
natural F±
l -torsor structure on the set LabCusp±(D ±). Write
V± def = Aut±(D ±)·V = Autcsp(D ±)·V ⊆ V(K)
[cf. the discussion of Example 4.3, (i); Remark 6.1.1 below] — where the “=”

considering what happens at the elements of V± Vbad] one verifies immediately
that the subgroup Aut±(D ±) ⊆Aut(D ±)∼

(vi) Let
†D ±
be any category isomorphic to D ±. Then just as in the discussion of (iii) in the
case of “v ∈Vnon”, it makes sense [cf. [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, as well as Remark
1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper] to speak of the set of cusps of †D ±, as well as the
set of ±-label classes of cusps
LabCusp±(†D ±)
— which, in this case, may be identified with the set of cusps of †D ±
.
(vii) Recall from [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [applied via the“Θ-approach” dis-
cussed in Remark 3.1.2], that [just as in the case of D — cf. the discussion of
Definition 4.1, (v)] there exists a group-theoretic algorithm for reconstructing, from
π1(D ±) [cf. §0], the algebraic closure “F” of the base field “K”, hence also the set
of valuations“V(F)” from D ± [e.g., as a collection of topologies on F — cf., e.g.,
[AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.8]. Moreover, for w ∈V(K)arc, let us recall [cf. Remark
3.1.2; [AbsTopIII], Corollaries 2.8, 2.9] that one may reconstruct group-theoretically,
from π1(D ±), the Aut-holomorphic orbispace Xw associated to Xw. Let †D ± be
as in (vi). Then let us write
V(†D ±)
for the set of valuations [i.e., “V(F)”], equipped with its natural π1(†D ±)-action,
V(†D ±) def
= V(†D ±)/π1(†D ±)
for the quotient of V(†D ±) by π1(†D ±) [i.e., “V(K)”], and, for w ∈V(†D ±)arc
,
X(†D ±,w)
[i.e., “Xw” — cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], Definition 5.1, (ii)] for the Aut-
holomorphic orbispace obtained by applying these group-theoretic reconstruction
algorithms to π1(†D ±). Now if U is an arbitrary Aut-holomorphic orbispace, then
let us define a morphism
U →†D ±
to be a morphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces [cf. [AbsTopIII], Definition 2.1,
(ii)] U →X(†D ±,w) for some w ∈V(†D ±)arc. Thus, it makes sense to speak of
the pre-composite (respectively, post-composite) of such a morphism U →†D ±
with a morphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces (respectively, with an isomorphism
[cf. §0] †D ± ∼
→‡D ± [i.e., where ‡D ± is a category equivalent to D ±]).
Remark 6.1.1. In fact, in the notation of Example 4.3, (i); Definition 6.1, (v), it
is not diﬃcult to verify [cf. Remark 3.1.2, (i)] that V±

(ii) The collection of data

the respective identifications with the “tautological D-prime-strip” {Dv}v∈V] by

(iii) Let α ∈{±1}V. Then α determines a natural poly-automorphism αΘ± of
order ∈{1,2}of the collection of data

acts on Fl as the identity and on Dt, for

0 : D0 →D ±

v0

the discussion of Example 4.3, (iv)]. Note that the presence of “β” in the defini-
tion of φΘell
v0 implies that it makes sense to post-compose φΘell
0 with an element of
Aut±(D ±)/Autcsp(D ±)∼

l . Thus, for any t ∈Fl ⊆F ±
l , let us write
φΘell
t : Dt →D ±
for the result of post-composing φΘell
0 with the “poly-action” [i.e., action via poly-
automorphisms] of t on D ± [and pre-composing with the tautological identification

φΘell

(ii) Let γ ∈F ±
l . Then γ determines a natural poly-automorphism γ± of D±
as follows: the automorphism γ± acts on Fl via the usual action of F ±
l on Fl and,
∼
for t ∈Fl, induces the +-full poly-isomorphism Dt
→Dγ(t) whose sign at every
v ∈V is equal to the sign of γ [cf. the construction of Example 6.2, (ii)]. Thus, we
obtain a natural poly-action of F ±
l on D±. On the other hand, the isomorphism

l of (i) determines a natural poly-action of F ±
l

The following additive analogue of Proposition 4.7 follows immediately from

explicit description of the various poly-automorphisms discussed in Examples 6.2,
(ii), (iii); 6.3, (ii) [cf. also the various properties discussed in Proposition 6.5], that
we have the following additive analogue of Proposition 4.8.
Proposition 6.6. (First Properties of Base-Θ±-Bridges, Base-Θell-Bridges,
and Base-Θ±ell-Hodge Theaters) Relative to a fixed collection of initial Θ-
data:
(i) The set of isomorphisms between two D-Θ±-bridges forms a torsor
over the group
{±1} × {±1}V
— where the first (respectively, second) factor corresponds to poly-automorphisms of
the sort described in Example 6.2, (ii) (respectively, Example 6.2, (iii)). Moreover,
the first factor may be thought of as corresponding to the induced isomorphisms of
F±
l -groups between the index sets of the capsules involved.
(ii) The set of isomorphisms between two D-Θell-bridges forms an F ±
l-
torsor — i.e., more precisely, a torsor over a finite group that is equipped with a
natural outer isomorphism to F ±
l . Moreover, this set of isomorphisms maps
bijectively, by considering the induced bijections, to the set of isomorphisms of
F±
l -torsors between the index sets of the capsules involved.
(iii) The set of isomorphisms between two D-Θ±ell-Hodge theaters forms
a {±1}-torsor. Moreover, this set of isomorphisms maps bijectively, by consid-
ering the induced bijections, to the set of isomorphisms of F±
l -groups between the
index sets of the capsules involved.
166 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
(iv) Given a D-Θ±-bridge and a D-Θell-bridge, the set of capsule-+-full poly-
isomorphisms between the respective capsules of D-prime-strips which allow one to
glue the given D-Θ±- and D-Θell-bridges together to form a D-Θ±ell-Hodge theater
forms a torsor over the group
F ±
l × {±1}V
— where the first factor corresponds to the F ±
l of (ii); the subgroup {±1} ×
{±1}V corresponds to the group of (i). Moreover, the first factor may be thought
of as corresponding to the induced isomorphisms of F±
l -torsors between the index
sets of the capsules involved.
(v) Given a D-Θell-bridge, there exists a [relatively simple — cf. the discus-
sion of Example 6.2, (i)] functorial algorithm for constructing, up to an F ±
l-
indeterminacy [cf. (ii), (iv)], from the given D-Θell-bridge a D-Θ±ell-Hodge

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM

a Θ±ell-Hodge theater — is illustrated in Fig. 6.1 above. Thus, Fig. 6.1 may be
thought of as a sort of additive analogue of the multiplicative situation illustrated
in Fig. 4.4. In Fig. 6.1, the “⇑” corresponds to the associated [D-]Θ±-bridge, while
the “⇓” corresponds to the associated [D-]Θell-bridge; the “/±’s” denote D-prime-
strips.
Proposition 6.7. (Base-Θ-Bridges Associated to Base-Θ±-Bridges) Rel-
ative to a fixed collection of initial Θ-data, let
†φΘ±
†DT
±
−→ †D≻
be a D-Θ±-bridge, as in Definition 6.4, (i). Then by replacing †DT by †DT [cf.
Definition 6.4, (i)], identifying the D-prime-strip †D≻ with the D-prime-strip †D0
via †φΘ±
0 [cf. the discussion of Definition 6.4, (i)] to form a D-prime-strip †D>,
replacing the various +-full poly-morphisms that occur in †φΘ±
± at the v ∈Vgood
by the corresponding full poly-morphisms, and replacing the various +-full poly-
morphisms that occur in †φΘ±
± at the v ∈Vbad by the poly-morphisms described [via
group-theoretic algorithms!] in Example 4.4, (i), (ii), we obtain a functorial
algorithm for constructing a [well-defined, up to a unique isomorphism!] D-Θ-
bridge
†φΘ
†DT
−→ †D>
as in Definition 4.6, (ii). Thus, the newly constructed D-Θ-bridge is related to the
given D-Θ±-bridge via the following correspondences:
†DT|(T\{0}) →†DT ; †D0,
†D≻ →†D>
— each of which maps precisely two D-prime-strips to a single D-prime-strip.
Proof. The various assertions of Proposition 6.7 follow immediately from the
various definitions involved. ⃝
Next, we consider additive analogues of Propositions 4.9, 4.11; Corollary 4.12.

try given by the action of a finite group that is equipped with a natural outer
isomorphism to F ±
l — which acts doubly transitively [i.e., transitively with
stabilizers of order two] on the index set [i.e., “T”] of the underlying capsule of
D-prime-strips [i.e., “†DT”] of this output data.
(ii) (Holomorphic Capsules) The operation of associating to a D-Θ±ell

Hodge theater †HTD-Θ±ell
the l±-capsule
†D|T|
associated to the underlying D-Θ±-bridge of †HTD-Θ±ell [cf. Definition 6.4, (i)]

category of l±-capsules
of D-prime-strips

†HTD-Θ±ell
→ †D|T|
whose output data admits an Sl±-symmetry [where we write Sl± for the symmet-
ric group on l± letters] which acts transitively on the index set [i.e., “|T|”] of this
output data. Thus, this functor may be thought of as an operation that consists of
forgetting the labels ∈|Fl|= Fl/{±1}[i.e., forgetting the bijection |T|∼ →|Fl|
determined by the F±
l -group structure of T — cf. Definition 6.4, (i)]. In particular,
if one is only given this output data †D|T| up to isomorphism, then there is a total
of precisely l± possibilities for the element ∈|Fl|to which a given index |t|∈|T|
corresponds, prior to the application of this functor.
(iii) (Mono-analytic Capsules) By composing the functor of (ii) with the
mono-analyticization operation discussed in Definition 4.1, (iv), one obtains a
natural functor
category of
D-Θ±ell-Hodge theaters
and isomorphisms of
D-Θ±ell-Hodge theaters

whose output data satisfies the same symmetry properties with respect to labels as
the output data of the functor of (ii).
Proof. Assertions (i), (ii), (iii) follow immediately from the definitions [cf. also
Proposition 6.6, (ii), in the case of assertion (i)]. ⃝

Proposition 6.9. (Processions of Base-Prime-Strips) Relative to a fixed
collection of initial Θ-data:
(i) (Holomorphic Processions) Given a D-Θ±-bridge †φΘ±
± : †DT →†D≻,
with underlying capsule of D-prime-strips †DT [cf. Definition 6.4, (i)], denote
by Prc(†DT) the l±-procession of D-prime-strips [cf. Fig. 6.2, where each
“/±” denotes a D-prime-strip] determined by considering the [“sub”]capsules of
the capsule †D|T| of Definition 6.4, (i), corresponding to the subsets S±

notation for nonnegative integers to denote the images of these nonnegative integers
in |Fl|], relative to the bijection |T|∼ →|Fl|determined by the F±
l -group structure of
T [cf. Definition 6.4, (i)]. Then the assignment †φΘ±

whose output data satisfies the following property: for each n ∈{1,...,l±}, there
are precisely n possibilities for the element ∈ |Fl| to which a given index of
the index set of the n-capsule that appears in the procession constituted by this
output data corresponds, prior to the application of this functor. That is to say,
by taking the product, over elements of |Fl|, of cardinalities of “sets of possibilies”,
one concludes that
by considering processions — i.e., the functor discussed above, possibly
pre-composed with the functor †HTD-Θ±ell
→†φΘ±
± that associates to a
D-Θ±ell-Hodge theater its associated D-Θ±-bridge — the indeterminacy
consisting of (l±)(l±) possibilities that arises in Proposition 6.8, (ii), is
reduced to an indeterminacy consisting of a total of l±! possibilities.
(ii) (Mono-analytic Processions) By composing the functor of (i) with the
mono-analyticization operation discussed in Definition 4.1, (iv), one obtains a

(iii) The functors of (i), (ii) are compatible, respectively, with the functors of
Proposition 4.11, (i), (ii), relative to the functor [i.e., determined by the functorial
algorithm] of Proposition 6.7, in the sense that the natural inclusions

Etale-picture of D-Θ±ell-Hodge theaters
(iii) If we regard each of the D-Θ±ell-Hodge theaters of the chain of (ii) as
a spoke emanating from the mono-analytic core discussed in (ii), then we ob-
tain a diagram — i.e., an´ etale-picture of D-Θ±ell-Hodge theaters — as in
Fig. 6.3 [cf. the situation discussed in Corollary 3.9, (i)]. In Fig. 6.3, “>⊢”
denotes the mono-analytic core, obtained [cf. (i); Proposition 6.7] by identifying
the mono-analyticized D-prime-strips of the D-Θ±ell-Hodge theater labeled “0” and
“≻”; “/± →/±/± →...” denotes the “holomorphic” processions of Proposition
6.9, (i), together with the remaining [“holomorphic”] data of the corresponding D-
Θ±ell-Hodge theater. In particular, the mono-analyticizations of the zero-labeled
D-prime-strips — i.e., the D-prime-strips corresponding to the first “/±” in the pro-
cessions just discussed — in the various spokes are identified with one another.
Put another way, the coric D⊢-prime-strip “>⊢” may be thought of as being equipped
with various distinct “holomorphic structures” — i.e., D-prime-strip struc-
tures that give rise to the D⊢-prime-strip structure — corresponding to the various
172 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
spokes. Finally, [cf. the situation discussed in Corollary 3.9, (i)] this diagram sat-
isfies the important property of admitting arbitrary permutation symmetries
among the spokes [i.e., among the labels n ∈Z of the D-Θ±ell-Hodge theaters].
(iv) The constructions of (i), (ii), (iii) are compatible, respectively, with
the constructions of Corollary 4.12, (i), (ii), (iii), relative to the functor [i.e.,
determined by the functorial algorithm] of Proposition 6.7, in the evident sense [cf.
the compatibility discussed in Proposition 6.9, (iii)].
Finally, we conclude with additive analogues of Definition 5.5, Corollary 5.6.

†F|T|
for the l±-capsule obtained from the l-capsule †FT by forming the quotient |T|of
the index set T of this underlying capsule by the action of {±1}and identifying the
components of the capsule †FT indexed by the elements in the fibers of the quotient

(respectively, associated D-Θell-bridges; associated D-Θ±ell-Hodge theaters)

torsor over the group

Remark 6.12.1. By applying Corollary 6.12, a similar remark to Remark 5.6.1
may be made concerning the Θ±-bridges, Θell-bridges, and Θ±ell-Hodge theaters
studied in the present §6. We leave the routine details to the reader.
Remark 6.12.2. Relative to a fixed collection of initial Θ-data:
(i) Suppose that (†FT → †F≻) is a Θ±-bridge; write (†DT → †D≻) for
the associated D-Θ±-bridge [cf. Definition 6.11, (i)]. Then Proposition 6.7 gives
a functorial algorithm for constructing a D-Θ-bridge (†DT → †D>) from this
D-Θ±-bridge (†DT → †D≻). Suppose that this D-Θ-bridge (†DT → †D>)
arises as the D-Θ-bridge associated to a Θ-bridge (‡FJ → ‡F> ‡HTΘ) [so
J= T — cf. Definition 5.5, (ii)]. Then since the portion “‡FJ →‡F>” of this
Θ-bridge is completely determined [cf. Definition 5.5, (ii), (d)] by the associated
D-Θ-bridge, one verifies immediately that
one may regard this portion “‡FJ →‡F>” of the Θ-bridge as having been
constructedviaafunctorial algorithmsimilartothefunctorialalgorithmof
Proposition 6.7 [cf. also Definition 5.5, (ii), (d); the discussion of Remark
5.3.1] from the Θ±-bridge (†FT → †F≻).
Since, moreover, isomorphisms between Θ-bridges are in natural bijective corre-
spondence with isomorphisms between the associated D-Θ-bridges [cf. Corollary
5.6, (ii)], it thus follows immediately [cf. Corollary 5.3, (ii)] that isomorphisms
between Θ-bridges are in natural bijective correspondence with isomorphisms be-
tween the portions of Θ-bridges [i.e., “‡FJ →‡F>”] considered above. Thus, in
summary, if (‡FJ → ‡F> ‡HTΘ) is a Θ-bridge for which the portion
“‡FJ →‡F>” is obtained via the functorial algorithm discussed above from the
Θ±-bridge (†FT → †F≻), then, for simplicity, we shall describe this state of aﬀairs
by saying that
the Θ-bridge (‡FJ → ‡F> ‡HTΘ) is glued to the Θ±-bridge
(†FT → †F≻) via the functorial algorithm of Proposition 6.7.
We leave the routine details of giving a more explicit description [say, in the style
of the statement of Proposition 6.7] of such functorial algorithms to the reader. A
similar [but easier!] construction may be given for D-Θ-bridges and D-Θ±-bridges.
(ii) Now observe that
by gluing a Θ±ell-Hodge theater [cf. Definition 6.11, (iii)] to a ΘNF-
Hodge theater [cf. Definition 5.5, (iii)] along the respective associated
Θ±- and Θ-bridges via the functorial algorithm of Proposition 6.7 [cf. (i)],
one obtains the notion of a
“Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater”
— cf. Definition 6.13, (i), below. Here, we note that by Proposition 4.8, (ii);
Corollary 5.6, (ii), the gluing isomorphism that occurs in such a gluing operation
is unique. Then by applying Propositions 4.8, 6.6, and Corollaries 5.6, 6.12, one

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 175
may verify analogues of these results for such Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters. In a similar
vein, one may glue a D-Θ±ell-Hodge theater to a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater to obtain a
“D-Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater” [cf. Definition 6.13, (ii), below]. We leave the routine
details to the reader.
Remark 6.12.3.
(i) One way to think of the notion of a ΘNF-Hodge theater studied in §4 is as
a sort of
total space of a local system of Fl -torsors
over a “base space” that represents a sort of “homotopy” between a number field
and a Tate curve [i.e., the elliptic curve under consideration at the v ∈Vbad]. From
this point of view, the notion of a Θ±ell-Hodge theater studied in the present §6
may be thought of as a sort of
total space of a local system of F ±
l -torsors
over a similar “base space”. Here, it is interesting to note that these Fl - and F ±
l-
torsors arise, on the one hand, from the l-torsion points of the elliptic curve under
consideration, hence may be thought of as
discrete approximations of
[the geometric portion of] this elliptic curve over a number field
[cf. the point of view of scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory discussed in [HA-
SurI],§1.3.4]. Ontheotherhand, ifonethinksintermsofthetempered fundamental
groups of the Tate curves that occur at v ∈Vbad, then these Fl - and F ±
l -torsors
may be thought of as
finite approximations of the copy of “Z”
that occurs as the Galois group of a well-known tempered covering of the Tate
curve [cf. the discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.2]. Note, moreover, that if one
works with Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters [cf. Remark 6.12.2, (ii)], then one is, in eﬀect,
working with both the additive and the multiplicative structures of this copy
of Z — although, unlike the situation that occurs when one works with rings,
i.e., in which the additive and multiplicative structures are “entangled” with
one another in some sort of complicated fashion [cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII],
Remark 5.6.1], if one works with Θ±ellNF-Hodge theaters, then each of the additive
and multiplicative structures occurs in an independent fashion [i.e., in the form of
Θ±ell- and ΘNF-Hodge theaters], i.e., “extracted” from this entanglement.
(ii) At this point, it is useful to recall that the idea of a distinct [i.e., from the
copy of Z implicit in the “base space”] “local system-theoretic” copy of Z occurring
over a “base space” that represents a number field is reminiscent not only of the
discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.2, but also of the Teichm¨ uller-theoretic point of
viewdiscussedin[AbsTopIII],§I5. Thatistosay, relativetotheanalogywithp-adic
Teichm¨ uller theory, the “base space” that represents a number field corresponds to
a hyperbolic curve in positive characteristic, while the “local system-theoretic”
176 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
copy of Z — which, as discussed in (i), also serves as a discrete approximation of
the [geometric portion of the] elliptic curve under consideration — corresponds to
a nilpotent ordinary indigenous bundle over the positive characteristic hyperbolic
curve.
(iii)Relativetotheanalogydiscussedin(ii)betweenthe“localsystem-theoretic”
copy of Z of (i) and the indigenous bundles that occur in p-adic Teichm¨ uller theory,
it is interesting to note that the two combinatorial dimensions [cf. [AbsTopIII], Re-
mark 5.6.1] corresponding to the additive and multiplicative [i.e., “F ±
l -” and
“Fl -”] symmetries of Θ±ell-, ΘNF-Hodge theaters may be thought of as corre-
sponding, respectively, to the two real dimensions
z·cos(t)+sin(t)
·z →z +a, z →−z +a;
z·cos(t)−sin(t)
·z →
z·sin(t)+cos(t), z →
z·sin(t)−cos(t)
— where a,t ∈R; z denotes the standard coordinate on H — of transformations of
the upper half-plane H, i.e., an object that is very closely related to the canonical
indigenous bundles that occur in the classical complex uniformization theory of
hyperbolic Riemann surfaces [cf. the discussions of Remarks 4.3.3, 5.1.4]. Here,
it is also of interest to observe that the above additive symmetry of the upper
half-plane is closely related to the coordinate on the upper half-plane determined
by the “classical q-parameter”
q
def
= e2πiz
— a situation that is reminiscent of the close relationship, in the theory of the
present series of papers, between the F ±
l -symmetry and the Kummer theory
surrounding the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the theta function on the
l-torsion points at bad primes [cf. Remark 6.12.6, (ii), below; the theory of
[IUTchII]]. Moreover, the fixed basepoint “V±” [cf. Definition 6.1, (v)] with respect
to which one considers l-torsion points in the context of the F ±
l -symmetry is rem-
iniscent of the fact that the above additive symmetries of the upper half-plane fix
the cusp at infinity. Indeed, taken as a whole, the geometry and coordinate natu-
rally associated to this additive symmetry of the upper half-plane may be thought
of, at the level of “combinatorial prototypes”, as the geometric apparatus as-
sociated to a cusp [i.e., as opposed to a node — cf. the discussion of [NodNon],
Introduction]. By contrast, the “toral” multiplicative symmetry of the upper
half-plane recalled above is closely related to the coordinate on the upper half-plane
that determines a biholomorphic isomorphism with the unit disc

— a situation that is reminiscent of the close relationship, in the theory of the

§5 of the present paper]. Moreover, the action of Fl on the “collection of basepoints
for the l-torsion points” VBor
= Fl·V±un [cf. Example 4.3, (i)] in the context of
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 177
the Fl -symmetry is reminiscent of the fact that the multiplicative symmetries of
the upper half-plane recalled above act transitively on the entire boundary of the
upper half-plane. That is to say, taken as a whole, the geometry and coordinate
naturally associated to this multiplicative symmetry of the upper half-plane may
be thought of, at the level of “combinatorial prototypes”, as the geometric
apparatus associated to a node, i.e., of the sort that occurs in the reduction modulo
p of a Hecke correspondence [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 4.11.4, (iii),
(c); [NodNon], Introduction]. Finally, we note that, just as in the case of the
F ±
l -, Fl -symmetries discussed in the present paper, the only “coric” symmetries,
i.e., symmetries common to both the additive and multiplicative symmetries of the
upper half-plane recalled above, are the symmetries “{±1}” [i.e., the symmetries
z →z,−z in the case of the upper half-plane]. The observations of the above
discussion are summarized in Fig. 6.4 below.
Remark 6.12.4.
(i) Just as in the case of the Fl -symmetry of Proposition 4.9, (i), the F ±
l-
symmetry of Proposition 6.8, (i), will eventually be applied, in the theory of the
present series of papers [cf. theory of [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]], to establish an
explicit network of comparison isomorphisms
relating various objects — such as log-volumes — associated to the non-labeled
prime-strips that are permuted by this symmetry [cf. the discussion of Remark
4.9.1, (i)]. Moreover, just as in the case of the Fl -symmetry studied in §4 [cf. the
discussion of Remark 4.9.2], one important property of this “network of comparison
isomorphisms” is that it operates without “label crushing” [cf. Remark 4.9.2, (i)]
— i.e., without disturbing the bijective relationship between the set of indices of
the symmetrized collection of prime-strips and the set of labels ∈T∼
→Fl under
consideration. Finally, just as in the situation studied in §4,
this crucial synchronization of labels is essentially a consequence of
the single connected component
— or, at a more abstract level, the single basepoint — of the global object [i.e.,
“†D ±” in the present §6; “†D ” in §4] that appears in the [D-Θ±ell- or D-ΘNF-]
Hodge theater under consideration [cf. Remark 4.9.2, (ii)].
(ii) At a more concrete level, the “synchronization of labels” discussed in (i) is
realized by means of the crucial bijections
†ζ : LabCusp(†D )∼
→J; †ζ± : LabCusp±(†D ±)∼
→T
of Propositions 4.7, (iii); 6.5, (iii). Here, we pause to observe that it is precisely the
existence of these
bijections relating index sets of capsules of D-prime-strips to sets of
global [±-]label classes of cusps

do not admit a compatible bijection between the index sets of the capsules involved
and some sort of set of [±-]label classes of cusps [cf. the discussion of Remark 4.9.2,
(i)]. This relationship with a set of [±-]label classes of cusps will play a crucial role
in the theory of the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the ´ etale theta function
that will be developed in [IUTchII].
(iii) On the other hand, one significant feature of the additive theory of the
present §6 which does not appear in the multiplicative theory of §4 is the phe-
nomenon of “global ±-synchronization” — i.e., at a more concrete level, the
various isomorphisms “†ξ” that appear in Proposition 6.5, (i), (ii) — between
the ±-indeterminacies that occur at the various v ∈ V. Note that this global
±-synchronization is a necessary “pre-condition” [i.e., since the natural addi-
tive action of Fl on Fl is not compatible with the natural surjection Fl |Fl|] for
the additive portion [i.e., corresponding to Fl ⊆F ±
l ] of the F ±
l -symmetry of
Proposition 6.8, (i). This “additive portion” of the F ±
l -symmetry plays the crucial
role of allowing one to relate the zero and nonzero elements of Fl [cf. the discussion
of Remark 6.12.5 below].
(iv) One important property of both the “†ζ’s” discussed in (ii) and the “†ξ’s”
discussed in (iii) is that they are constructed by means of functorial algorithms
fromtheintrinsic structureofaD-Θ±ell-orD-ΘNF-Hodgetheater[cf. Propositions
4.7, (iii); 6.5, (i), (ii), (iii)] — i.e., not by means of comparison with some fixed
reference model [cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I4], such as the objects
constructed in Examples 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 6.2, 6.3. This property will be of crucial
importance when, in the theory of [IUTchIII], we combine the theory developed in
the present series of papers with the theory of log-shells developed in [AbsTopIII].
Remark 6.12.5.
(i) One fundamental diﬀerence between the Fl -symmetry of §4 and the F ±
l-
symmetry of the present §6 lies in the inclusion of the zero element ∈Fl in the
symmetry under consideration. This inclusion of the zero element ∈Fl means,
in particular, that the resulting network of comparison isomorphisms [cf. Remark
6.12.4, (i)]
allowsonetorelatethe“zero-labeled” prime-striptothevarious“nonzero-
labeled” prime-strips, i.e., the prime-strips labeled by nonzero elements
∈Fl [or, essentially equivalently, ∈Fl ].
Moreover, as reviewed in Remark 6.12.4, (ii), the F ±
l -symmetry allows one to
relate the zero-labeled and non-zero-labeled prime-strips to one another in a “com-
binatorially holomorphic” fashion, i.e., in a fashion that is compatible with the
various natural bijections [i.e., “†ζ”] with various sets of global ±-label classes of
cusps. Here, it is useful to recall that evaluation at [torsion points closely related to]
the zero-labeled cusps [cf. the discussion of “evaluation points” in Example 4.4, (i)]
plays an important role in the theory of normalization of the ´ etale theta function
180 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
— cf. the theory of ´ etale theta functions “of standard type”, as discussed in [EtTh],
Theorem 1.10; the theory to be developed in [IUTchII].
(ii) Whereas the F ±
l -symmetry of the theory of the present §6 has the ad-
vantage that it allows one to relate zero-labeled and non-zero-labeled prime-strips,
it has the [tautological!] disadvantage that it does not allow one to “insulate”
the non-zero-labeled prime-strips from confusion with the zero-labeled prime-strip.

Moreover, ultimately, in[IUTchII],[IUTchIII],weshallrelatetheseGaussianFrobe-
nioids to various global arithmetic line bundles on the number field F. This will
require the use of both the additive and the multiplicative structures on the number
field; in particular, it will require the use of the theory developed in §5.
(iii) By contrast, since, in the theory of the present series of papers, we shall
not be interested in analogues of the Gaussian Frobenioids that involve the zero-
labeled evaluation points, we shall not require an “additive analogue” of the portion
[cf. Example 5.1] of the theory developed in §5 concerning global Frobenioids.
Remark 6.12.6.
(i) Another fundamental diﬀerence between the Fl -symmetry of §4 and the
F ±
l -symmetry of the present §6 lies in the geometric nature of the “single base-
point” [cf. the discussion of Remark 6.12.4] that underlies the F ±
l -symmetry. That
is to say, the various labels ∈T∼
→Fl that appear in a [D-]Θ±ell-Hodge theater cor-
respond — throughout the various portions [e.g., bridges] of the [D-]Θ±ell-Hodge
theater — to collections of cusps in a single copy [i.e., connected component] of
“Dv” at each v ∈V; these collections of cusps are permuted by the F ±
l -symmetry
of the [D-]Θell-bridge [cf. Proposition 6.8, (i)] without permuting the collection of
valuations V± (⊆V(K)) [cf. the discussion of Definition 6.1, (v)]. This contrasts
sharply with the arithmetic nature of the “single basepoint” [cf. the discussion
of Remark 6.12.4] that underlies the Fl -symmetry of §4, i.e., in the sense that
the Fl -symmetry [cf. Proposition 4.9, (i)] permutes the various Fl -translates of
V±
= V±un ⊆VBor (⊆V(K)) [cf. Example 4.3, (i); Remark 6.1.1].
(ii) The geometric nature of the “single basepoint” of the F ±
l -symmetry of
a [D-]Θ±ell-Hodge theater [cf. (i)] is more suited to the theory of the
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the´ etale theta function
to be developed in [IUTchII], in which the existence of a “single basepoint” cor-
responding to a single connected component of “Dv” for v ∈Vbad plays a central
role.
(iii) By contrast, the arithmetic nature of the “single basepoint” of the Fl-
symmetry of a [D-]ΘNF-Hodge theater [cf. (i)] is more suited to the
¨
INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHM
ULLER THEORY I 181
explicit construction of the number field Fmod [cf. Example 5.1]
— i.e., to the construction of an object which is invariant with respect to the
Aut(CK)/Autϵ(CK)∼
→Fl -symmetries that appear in the discussion of Example
4.3, (iv). That is to say, if one attempts to carry out a similar construction to
the construction of Example 5.1 with respect to the copy of D ± that appears
in a [D-]Θell-bridge, then one must sacrifice the crucial ridigity with respect to
Aut(D ±)/Aut±(D ±)∼
→Fl [cf. Definition 6.1, (v)] that arises from the struc-
ture [i.e., definition] of a [D-]Θell-bridge [cf. Example 6.3; Definition 6.4, (ii)].
Moreover, if one sacrifices this Fl -rigidity, then one no longer has a situation in
which the symmetry under consideration is defined relative to a single copy of “Dv
”
at each v ∈V, i.e., defined with respect to a “single geometric basepoint”. In par-
ticular, once one sacrifices this Fl -rigidity, the resulting symmetries are no longer
compatible with the theory of the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the ´ etale
theta function to be developed in [IUTchII] [cf. (ii)].
(iv) One way to understand the diﬀerence discussed in (iii) between the global
portions[i.e.,theportionsinvolvingcopiesofD ,D ±]ofa[D-]ΘNF-Hodgetheater
and a [D-]Θ±ell-Hodge theater is as a reflection of the fact that whereas the Borel
subgroup
∗ ∗
0 ∗
⊆ SL2(Fl)
is normally terminal in SL2(Fl) [cf. the discussion of Example 4.3], the “semi-
unipotent” subgroup
±1 ∗
0 ±1
⊆ SL2(Fl)
[which corresponds to the subgroup Aut±(D ±) ⊆Aut(D ±) — cf. the discussion
of Definition 6.1, (v)] fails to be normally terminal in SL2(Fl).
(v) In summary, taken as a whole, a [D-]Θ±ellNF-Hodge theater [cf. Remark
6.12.2, (ii)] may be thought of as a sort of
“intricate relay between geometric and arithmetic basepoints”
that allows one to carry out, in a consistent fashion, both
(a) the theory of the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the ´ etale theta
function to be developed in [IUTchII] [cf. (ii)] and
(b) the explicit construction of the number field Fmod in Example 5.1 [cf.
(iii)].
Moreover, if one thinks of Fl as a finite approximation of Z [cf. Remark 6.12.3],
then this intricate relay between geometric and arithmetic — or, alternatively, F ±
l
[i.e., additive!]- and Fl [i.e., multiplicative!]- basepoints — may be thought of as a
sort of
global combinatorial resolution of the two combinatorial dimen-
sions — i.e., additive and multiplicative [cf. [AbsTopIII], Remark
5.6.1] — of the ring Z.
182 SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
Finally, we observe in passing that — from a computational point of view [cf. the
theory of [IUTchIV]!] — it is especially natural to regard Fl as a “good approxima-
tion” of Z when l is “suﬃciently large”, as is indeed the case in the situations
discussed in [GenEll], §4 [cf. also Remark 3.1.2, (iv)].
