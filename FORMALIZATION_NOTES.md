# Formalization Notes

These notes are the project diary and the seed of a later paper. Each Lean
milestone should be documented here in ordinary mathematical language: what was
formalized, why the definitions were chosen, what the Lean theorem actually says,
and what trap the design is meant to avoid.

## Method

We are treating Lean as a verification and disambiguation engine. The main rule
is that a Lean theorem should not contain the desired conclusion as a structure
field unless the theorem is explicitly marked as an interface placeholder. When
we introduce a placeholder, the research task is to replace it later by smaller
data and proofs.

This mirrors the "blueprint" style used in large Lean formalization projects:
human-readable mathematical text is kept synchronized with formal declarations.
Examples worth tracking are the Liquid Tensor Experiment blueprint
<https://leanprover-community.github.io/liquid/>, the Fermat's Last Theorem
blueprint <https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/FLT/blueprint/>, and recent
work on extracting blueprint data from Lean code in LeanArchitect
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22554>.

## Milestone 1: Labeled Real-Line Copies

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/RealLineCopy.lean`

### Purpose

The Scholze-Stix objection around IUT III, Corollary 3.12 is partly about
identifying several copies of one-dimensional ordered real vector spaces. Their
claim is that consistent identifications leave no room for the required `j^2`
scalings on the Theta side; inserting those scalars produces monodromy. Mochizuki's
position is that the Hodge-theater/log-link/multiradial apparatus makes some
comparisons legitimate precisely because the ring/scheme histories are not
silently identified.

Before formalizing log-volumes or pilot objects, we need a tiny discipline for
copies of the real line:

* a copy has a label;
* a point has a coordinate only relative to its copy;
* a comparison between copies is an explicit transport;
* a transport carries a positive scale, so it preserves the order orientation;
* a loop transport is trivial exactly when its scale is `1`.

This is intentionally much smaller than the IUT situation. Its job is to prevent
the first possible mistake: silently treating all real-number targets as the same
object.

### Lean Declarations

`RealLineCopy.Copy` is a labeled copy of the real line. Its only field is a
string label. This is not mathematically rich, but the label creates an explicit
place where later q-side, Theta-side, abstract-pilot, concrete-pilot, and
holomorphic-hull targets can differ.

`RealLineCopy.Point line` is a coordinate in a specific copy. The coordinate is a
plain real number, but the type records the copy to which the coordinate belongs.
This means a point of the q-copy is not definitionally a point of the Theta-copy.

`RealLineCopy.PositiveScale` is a real scalar with proof that it is positive. We
use positive scalars because the ordered real lines relevant to log-volume
comparisons should not be allowed to reverse order.

`RealLineCopy.Transport source target` is currently just a positive scaling from
one copy to another. Later this may be generalized to affine or abstract ordered
line isomorphisms if the mathematics requires it. For the first milestone,
positive scaling is exactly the structure needed to model identity comparison
versus scalar insertion.

`Transport.PointwiseEqual f g` means two transports induce the same coordinate
map on every point. The theorem
`Transport.pointwiseEqual_iff_scale_eq` proves that, for this model, pointwise
equality is equivalent to equality of scale factors.

`Transport.TrivialMonodromy f` means a loop transport is pointwise equal to the
identity transport. The theorem
`Transport.trivialMonodromy_iff_scale_eq_one` proves the core fact:

```text
a loop has trivial monodromy iff its scale is 1.
```

`Transport.scalarLoop_nontrivial_of_scale_ne_one` is the first formal expression
of the Scholze-Stix-style warning: if a scalar loop has scale not equal to `1`,
then it is not a trivial identification.

### What This Does Not Prove

This milestone does not prove anything about IUT, Corollary 3.12, q-pilots,
Theta-pilots, Frobenioids, Hodge theaters, or log-volumes.

It only proves a small control theorem for a future model: if we later insert a
`j^2` scaling into a closed comparison diagram, then we must either show that the
resulting loop is not meant to be trivial, or prove that the relevant
indeterminacy/hull operation changes the comparison relation. We cannot call it
an ordinary identity unless the scale is `1`.

### Design Trap Avoided

The dangerous shortcut would be to represent every log-volume target simply as
`Real`. That would erase the distinction between q-side and Theta-side real
coordinates before we have proved that such erasure is legitimate. This file does
the opposite: it makes every erasure or comparison pass through an explicit
transport.

## Milestone 2: Coherent Transport Diagrams

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/TransportDiagram.lean`

### Source Check

Before implementing this milestone, we rechecked the local primary texts.

Scholze-Stix say that, because the argument compares real numbers and several
ordered one-dimensional real vector spaces arise, it is critical to spell out all
identifications of copies of real numbers. In their diagnosis, adding `j^2`
scalars to the left side of the diagram produces monodromy; with consistent
identifications, those scalars must be omitted.

Mochizuki's IUT III, Remark 3.12.2, gives a toy model with two distinct labeled
copies `qR` and `ThetaR` of the real numbers. He emphasizes that forgetting the
distinct labels makes the assignments incompatible, while the labels and the
abstract symbol make simultaneous logical consideration possible. Later, an
assignment with indeterminacies is supposed to be intrinsically associated to the
q-side assignment even after the copies are identified.

Mochizuki's April 2026 progress report says that the Stage 1 Lean target should
focus on the simultaneous comparison of the q-pilot and Theta-pilot, with SHE
and IPL as part of the `3.11.5 => 3.12` package.

The formal move below captures only the elementary "consistent identification"
side of this discussion. It does not model the claimed indeterminacy/hull escape
route yet.

### Purpose

Milestone 1 handled a single loop. Milestone 2 handles two parallel comparison
paths between the same labeled real-line copies. This is closer to the diagrams
in the Scholze-Stix discussion: one path is a baseline comparison, while another
path is the same comparison with an extra scalar inserted.

The intended control theorem is:

```text
if a transport and its scalar-rescaled version form a coherent parallel diagram,
then the inserted scalar is 1.
```

Equivalently:

```text
if the inserted scalar is not 1, the parallel diagram is not coherent.
```

### Lean Declarations

`Transport.rescale s f` takes a transport `f` and multiplies its scale by the
positive scale `s`.

`Transport.ParallelPair source target` is a pair of parallel transports between
the same labeled copies.

`Transport.ParallelPair.Coherent p` means that the two paths are pointwise equal
as maps on coordinates.

`Transport.ParallelPair.coherent_iff_scale_eq` proves that, in this model,
coherence of parallel paths is equivalent to equality of their scale factors.

`Transport.coherent_rescale_iff_scale_eq_one` proves the central theorem of this
milestone:

```text
Coherent(f, rescale s f) iff s = 1.
```

`Transport.incoherent_rescale_of_scale_ne_one` packages the contrapositive:
nontrivial scalar insertion prevents coherence.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to define a "commutative diagram" as a proposition field and
then freely use it without understanding what it forces. Here we define
coherence as pointwise equality of transports, then prove Lean's reduction of
that condition to equality of scales. This keeps the mathematical content small
and inspectable.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce q-side and Theta-side log-volume assignments
as points in labeled real-line copies. Then we can express Mochizuki's toy model
directly:

```text
star |-> q(-h) in qR
star |-> Theta(-2h) in ThetaR
```

and separately express the indeterminacy version:

```text
star |-> Theta(R_{<= -2h + epsilon}) in ThetaR.
```

That will let us distinguish three things in Lean: labeled simultaneous
assignments, forced unlabeled identification, and comparison through an explicit
transport or indeterminacy relation.

## Milestone 3: The IUT III Toy Model

Lean file: `Iut/Stage1/ToyModel.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone is tied directly to IUT III, Remark 3.12.2, especially the
subparagraphs `(atoy)` through `(ftoy)`. Mochizuki describes two distinct labeled
copies `qR` and `ThetaR`, an abstract symbol `*`, and assignments

```text
lambda_q     : * |-> q(-h)        in qR
lambda_Theta : * |-> Theta(-2h)   in ThetaR.
```

He then says that if the labels `q` and `Theta` are forgotten, the assignments
become incompatible because `-h != -2h` for `h > 0`. He replaces the second
assignment by an indeterminacy version

```text
lambda_Theta^Ind : * |-> Theta(R_{<= -2h + epsilon})
```

and concludes formally that membership of `-h` in this region gives
`-h <= -2h + epsilon`, hence `h <= epsilon`.

This is also responsive to Scholze-Stix, who emphasize that all identifications
between the ordered one-dimensional real vector spaces must be spelled out. The
toy model is where we can spell out the smallest possible version of that issue.

### Lean Declarations

`ToyModel.qLine` and `ToyModel.thetaLine` are the two labeled copies.

`ToyModel.qAssignment h` is the point with coordinate `-h` in `qLine`.

`ToyModel.thetaAssignment h` is the point with coordinate `-2h` in `thetaLine`.

`ToyModel.ForcedUnlabeledEquality h` is the proposition obtained by forgetting
the two labels and asserting equality of the resulting coordinates in one
ambient copy of `Real`.

The theorem

```text
forcedUnlabeledEquality_iff_eq_zero
```

proves that this forced equality is equivalent to `h = 0`. The theorem

```text
forcedUnlabeledEquality_contradicts_positive
```

packages the expected contradiction for `h > 0`.

`ToyModel.thetaIndeterminacyRegion h epsilon x` is the coordinate predicate
`x <= -2h + epsilon`.

`ToyModel.QInThetaIndeterminacyAfterForgetting h epsilon` says that the
q-coordinate `-h` lies in this region after labels are forgotten.

The theorem

```text
qInThetaIndeterminacy_iff_bound
```

proves the exact arithmetic equivalence:

```text
-h in R_{<= -2h + epsilon}  iff  h <= epsilon.
```

### What This Tests

This milestone tests both sides of the toy-model passage.

First, the naive forced identification of the exact assignments is impossible
for positive `h`. This matches Mochizuki's own warning in `(atoy)` and the
Scholze-Stix insistence that identifications of real-line copies must be
tracked.

Second, the indeterminacy-region replacement has the advertised arithmetic
effect: once one has justified membership of `-h` in `R_{<= -2h + epsilon}`,
Lean confirms that the formal bound `h <= epsilon` follows.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to make the indeterminacy step a field such as
`bound : h <= epsilon`. We do not do that. We define the region membership
predicate and prove that the bound is equivalent to membership. The hard future
mathematics is therefore isolated: one must justify the membership, not the
bound directly.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect this toy model back to explicit transports:
instead of "forgetting labels" by immediately reading both coordinates in `Real`,
we should express comparison through a named transport from `qLine` to
`thetaLine`. This will let us ask whether a proposed comparison path is exact,
scalar-rescaled, or indeterminacy-valued.

## Milestone 4: Toy Model Through Named Transports

Lean file: `Iut/Stage1/ToyModel.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone continues the same source check as Milestone 3. The relevant
mathematical tension is:

* Mochizuki's toy model begins with distinct labeled copies `qR` and `ThetaR`.
* Forgetting the labels directly makes the exact assignments `-h` and `-2h`
  incompatible when `h > 0`.
* Scholze-Stix stress that every identification between ordered one-dimensional
  real vector spaces must be made explicit.

Milestone 4 implements the explicit-identification version: instead of simply
forgetting labels, we compare the q-assignment to the Theta-assignment through a
named positive-scale transport from `qLine` to `thetaLine`.

### Lean Declarations

`ToyModel.TransportedExactEquality f h` says that applying the named transport
`f : Transport qLine thetaLine` to the q-point `q(-h)` gives the exact Theta
point `Theta(-2h)`.

The theorem

```text
transportedExactEquality_iff_scale_eq_two
```

proves that, for `h != 0`, exact transported equality is equivalent to the
transport scale being `2`.

This is a useful normalization check. In the raw coordinate-forgetting model,
equality of `-h` and `-2h` forced `h = 0`. Once a named transport is allowed,
exact equality can be recovered, but only by making the transport carry the
nontrivial scale `2`.

`ToyModel.unitQToTheta` is the unit-scale transport from the q-line to the
Theta-line. The theorem

```text
unitQToTheta_not_transportedExactEquality
```

shows that this unit comparison cannot send `q(-h)` to `Theta(-2h)` when
`h > 0`.

The more general theorem

```text
transportedUnitEquality_contradicts_positive
```

says the same thing for any transport whose scale is `1`.

`ToyModel.TransportedQInThetaIndeterminacy f h epsilon` is the
transport-sensitive version of the indeterminacy-region membership. It says that
the transported q-coordinate lies in the Theta-side region
`R_{<= -2h + epsilon}`.

The theorem

```text
unitTransportedQInThetaIndeterminacy_iff_bound
```

checks that the unit-transport version recovers the arithmetic equivalence from
Milestone 3: membership is equivalent to `h <= epsilon`.

### What This Tests

The milestone separates three notions that must remain distinct in later work:

1. Raw label-forgetting.
2. Exact comparison through a named transport.
3. Indeterminacy-region comparison through a named transport.

This matters because a proof may legitimately compare two labeled copies only
after specifying the comparison map. The formal result here says that the
comparison map itself carries mathematical content: exact comparison of the toy
assignments forces a nontrivial scale.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to say "identify qR and ThetaR" without recording whether the
identification has scale `1`, scale `2`, scale `j^2`, or is not an exact
identification at all but an indeterminacy-valued relation. This milestone
forces that choice into Lean data.

### Next Step

The next milestone should stop treating indeterminacy as just a predicate on
coordinates and introduce a small abstract interface for indeterminacy-valued
relations between labeled real-line copies. The immediate goal is to distinguish
"pointwise equality" from "membership in a hull/region after transport" at the
type level.

## Milestone 5: Region-Valued Comparison Interface

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/IndeterminacyRelation.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyModel.lean`

### Source Check

The source texts repeatedly distinguish exact comparison from comparison up to
regions, hulls, and indeterminacies.

In IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, Mochizuki introduces holomorphic hulls of regions and
explains that passing to hulls is used to handle indeterminacies of possible
regions. In the proof of Corollary 3.12 and Remark 3.12.2, he describes the
Theta-pilot side as being represented only up to suitable indeterminacies. In
the toy model, this appears as replacing the exact assignment
`Theta(-2h)` by the region-valued assignment `Theta(R_{<= -2h + epsilon})`.

Scholze-Stix likewise focus on whether the claimed "blurring" by
indeterminacies is large enough to make the relevant diagrams commute. That
critique only makes sense if exact equality and indeterminacy-valued comparison
are kept separate.

### Purpose

The purpose of this milestone is to move the word "indeterminacy" out of
informal comments and into a small Lean interface. We still do not define IUT
hulls, Frobenioid objects, or log-volume hull-approximants. Instead, we define
the weakest useful target:

```text
a comparison sends a source point, through a named transport,
into a target-side region.
```

Exact equality is represented as the special case where the target region is a
singleton.

### Lean Declarations

`RealLineCopy.Region line` is a predicate on points of a labeled real-line copy.

`Region.singleton x` is the exact one-point region.

`Region.upperRay line bound` is the region of points whose coordinate is at most
`bound`. This is the concrete shape used by the toy model
`R_{<= -2h + epsilon}`.

`RegionComparison source target` packages a named transport from `source` to
`target` and a target-side region.

`RegionComparison.Holds comparison x` says that the transported image of `x`
lies in the target region.

`RegionComparison.exact transport targetPoint` is exact comparison as a
singleton-region comparison.

`RegionComparison.upperRay transport bound` is upper-ray comparison after a
named transport.

The foundational lemmas

```text
RegionComparison.exact_holds_iff
RegionComparison.upperRay_holds_iff
```

unfold the two cases to ordinary coordinate statements. These are intentionally
simple lemmas: they make it clear that the interface is not hiding extra
mathematics.

In the toy model, we added:

```text
exactThetaComparison
thetaIndeterminacyComparison
```

and checked that the new interface recovers the previous toy-model statements.
In particular:

```text
unitThetaIndeterminacyComparison_holds_iff_bound
```

still proves that the unit-transported q-point belongs to the Theta upper-ray
region if and only if `h <= epsilon`.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests that "exact equality" and "membership in a target region"
are different Lean objects. This matters for the central dispute: a future proof
cannot silently replace exact equality by a hull/indeterminacy comparison unless
it explicitly changes the target from a singleton region to a larger region and
then proves membership in that larger region.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to encode indeterminacy as an unstructured proposition such as
`blurred_commutes : Prop`, then use it as if it were equality. Here the target
side is visibly a `Region`, and equality is only the singleton-region special
case. If a later theorem needs a hull, it must say which region/hull is being
used.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce a minimal notion of monotonic enlargement
of regions. This is the first abstraction needed for "passing to a hull":
if a point lies in a region and the region is contained in a larger region, then
the point lies in the larger region. This should remain purely order-theoretic
and should not yet attempt to formalize holomorphic hulls.

## Milestone 6: Region Enlargement and Abstract Hulls

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/IndeterminacyRelation.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, especially the formal properties
listed for the hull map `phi : P -> H`:

```text
(P1) phi(H) = H for hulls H,
(P2) P subset phi(P),
(P3) P1 subset P2 implies phi(P1) subset phi(P2).
```

The immediate formal need for our project is only `(P2)` and `(P3)`: hulls
enlarge regions and are monotone with respect to inclusion. The same remark says
that compatibility with the preorder structure given by inclusion plays an
important role in log-volume estimates. Later parts of Remark 3.9.5 explain that
passing to hulls eliminates or absorbs certain indeterminacies of possible
regions.

The April 2026 formalization report also says that Stage 1 moves the
`hull+det` operation into the intermediate `3.11.5` package. That supports
formalizing the hull-facing interface before we attempt any real Frobenioid or
determinant content.

### Purpose

The goal is to capture the order-theoretic core of "passing to a hull" without
pretending to have formalized holomorphic hulls. We only need enough structure
to say:

```text
if a comparison lands in a region, then it also lands in any larger region;
if a hull operation is extensive, then a comparison lands in the hull
whenever it lands in the original region.
```

This is the next safe abstraction after Milestone 5's region-valued comparisons.

### Lean Declarations

`Region.Subset small large` is pointwise containment of regions.

`Region.ExtEq left right` is extensional equality of regions by pointwise
logical equivalence.

The basic lemmas are:

```text
Region.subset_refl
Region.subset_trans
Region.contains_of_subset
Region.extEq_of_subset_of_subset
```

`Region.singleton_subset_iff` says that a singleton region is contained in a
region iff the singleton's point belongs to that region. The proof is a small
sanity check on our representation of points: since regions are predicates on
points, not just on raw coordinates, Lean must reconstruct equality of points
from equality of their only coordinate.

`Region.upperRay_subset_upperRay` proves that upper rays are monotone in their
bound. The iff version,

```text
Region.upperRay_subset_upperRay_iff
```

shows that this condition is exact.

`HullOperator line` is an abstract hull operation with two fields:

```text
extensive : region subset hull(region)
monotone  : small subset large -> hull(small) subset hull(large)
```

This deliberately omits IUT's actual holomorphic definition. It records only the
part of Remark 3.9.5 that we can use without importing analytic or Frobenioid
machinery.

`RegionComparison.enlargeTarget` replaces the target region of a comparison by
a larger one.

`RegionComparison.holds_of_target_subset` proves that region comparison survives
target enlargement.

`RegionComparison.hullTarget` replaces the target region by its abstract hull.

`RegionComparison.holds_hullTarget` proves that a comparison into a region also
holds after replacing that target by its hull.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests the exact proof obligation created by "passing to a hull":
membership must be transported along an explicit inclusion. We now have a Lean
place to put future claims that a holomorphic hull contains the original possible
image region.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to introduce a function named `hull` and use it as if it
automatically preserved every comparison. Here a hull operation has to provide
the `extensive` field. If an alleged hull construction does not prove that the
original region is contained in the hull, Lean will not let us transfer
membership.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce bounded families of possible regions, still
abstractly. Remark 3.9.5 uses a hull associated to a bounded collection of
possible regions to remove dependence on a particular possible output of the
multiradial algorithm. A first Lean model should represent a family
`beta |-> P_beta` and a common target region that contains every `P_beta`.

## Milestone 7: Families of Possible Regions

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/IndeterminacyRelation.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows the final part of IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, (vi), and
Remark 3.9.5, (vii), (Ob5). Mochizuki says that the discussion applies not only
to one region `P`, but also to bounded families

```text
P_B = { P_beta }_{beta in B}
```

and then describes a hull `phi(P_B)` associated to the family. In (Ob5), he
describes the choice of a specific possible region in the output of the
multiradial algorithm as internal to the algorithm; comparison with an external
object such as the q-pilot side should therefore use an object independent of
that specific choice, namely the hull associated to the collection of possible
regions.

This is also the place where the April 2026 progress report's phrase
"gluings up to indeterminacies" becomes relevant. A family of possible target
regions is the minimal formal container for such an indeterminacy of choices.

### Purpose

The goal is to represent the following pattern:

```text
for every choice beta, there is a possible region P_beta;
a common target region C contains every P_beta;
therefore, membership in any chosen P_beta implies membership in C.
```

This is the order-theoretic core of removing dependence on the particular
possible output chosen by an algorithm.

We still do not formalize boundedness, compactness, relative compactness,
log-volume, or the actual analytic construction of `phi(P_B)`. Those are future
milestones. The current milestone only records the containment structure that
later facts must satisfy.

### Lean Declarations

`RegionFamily line index` is a family of regions indexed by a type of choices.

`RegionFamily.ContainedIn family common` says that every region in the family is
contained in a common region.

`RegionFamily.contains_common_of_contains_choice` proves that if a point belongs
to a chosen possible region, and all possible regions are contained in a common
region, then the point belongs to the common region.

`RegionFamily.CommonHull family` packages a common region together with the
proof that it contains every possible region in the family. This is the abstract
shape of `phi(P_B)` for now.

`RegionFamily.CommonHull.enlarge` says that a larger region than a common hull
is again a common hull. This is a basic closure property needed for later
passes through coarser hulls or quotients.

`RegionComparisonFamily source target index` is a family of region comparisons.
This represents possible comparison outputs, all with the same source and target
copies but with possibly different target regions.

`RegionComparisonFamily.targetRegions` extracts the underlying family of target
regions.

`RegionComparisonFamily.CommonTarget family common` says that `common` contains
all target regions of the comparison family.

Theorems:

```text
holds_commonTarget_of_choice
holds_commonTargetHull_of_choice
```

say that if a chosen comparison holds, then it also holds after replacing that
chosen target region by a common target or common target hull.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests the exact logical step from "one of the possible regions
was chosen" to "we may work in a common region independent of the choice." The
proof is deliberately elementary: it is just membership transfer along inclusion.

That is useful because future IUT-specific work must supply the nontrivial
premise: that the proposed hull or common target really contains every possible
region generated by the multiradial algorithm.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to model an indeterminate algorithmic output as a single
region too early. That would erase the choice-dependence that Remark 3.9.5,
(Ob5), explicitly says must be handled. We now represent the choice-dependence
as an indexed family and require a proof before replacing it by a common target.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce a first log-volume abstraction over regions.
It should not try to define the analytic log-volume. It should only express the
monotonicity shape needed for upper-ray toy regions and later hull estimates:
when `small subset large`, the chosen numerical measure is ordered in the
appropriate direction.

## Milestone 8: Abstract Region Measures

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/RegionMeasure.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, where log-volume estimates are
discussed in the presence of hulls and possible regions. The relevant source
pattern is:

```text
mu_log(phi(P)) >= mu_log(H) >= mu_log(P)
```

for hull-approximants `H` associated to a region `P`, together with the
discussion in (Ob6) that one is ultimately interested in estimating log-volumes
but cannot simply replace the region-level construction by log-volumes too
early.

The proof of Corollary 3.12 also says that log-volumes are invariant under some
indeterminacies and convert the upper semi-compatibility indeterminacy `(Ind3)`
into an inequality from above. That is a later target. For this milestone we
only encode the monotonicity shape of region inclusion.

### Purpose

The goal is to introduce a numerical layer without pretending to define IUT
log-volume. We need a controlled interface that can support statements of the
form:

```text
small subset large  ->  volume(small) <= volume(large)
```

and then derive the consequences for hulls and common targets.

This keeps the formalization honest: if later we introduce an actual IUT
log-volume, it will have to instantiate this interface by proving monotonicity.

### Lean Declarations

`RegionMeasure line` is a real-valued function on regions of a labeled real-line
copy, together with a monotonicity proof.

Core lemmas:

```text
RegionMeasure.le_of_subset
RegionMeasure.le_hull
RegionMeasure.le_common_of_choice
RegionMeasure.le_commonHull_of_choice
```

These say that volumes are monotone under ordinary inclusion, passage to an
abstract hull, and passage from any chosen possible region to a common region or
common hull.

`RegionMeasure.HasVolumeAtMost measure region bound` is the proposition
`volume(region) <= bound`.

The theorem

```text
RegionMeasure.atMost_of_subset_of_atMost
```

says that an upper bound on a larger region gives an upper bound on any
contained smaller region. This is the direction needed when an estimate is
proved for a hull/common target and then applied to a specific possible region.

The theorem

```text
RegionMeasure.choice_atMost_of_common_atMost
```

specializes this to a family of possible regions contained in a common target.

For region comparisons, `RegionMeasure.targetVolume` measures the target region
of a comparison. The lemmas

```text
RegionMeasure.targetVolume_le_enlarge
RegionMeasure.targetVolume_le_hullTarget
RegionMeasure.choice_targetVolume_le_common
RegionMeasure.choice_targetVolume_le_commonHull
```

transfer the same monotonicity facts to comparison targets.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests that the numerical estimate layer depends only on explicit
containment hypotheses. No volume inequality is available merely because a
region is called a hull or an indeterminacy region. Lean requires the inclusion
or hull-extensiveness proof.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to make "log-volume" a magic function with the inequalities
needed for Corollary 3.12 already built into theorem statements. Here the only
built-in property is monotonicity under inclusion. This is intentionally too
weak to prove IUT-level conclusions by itself.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect the toy model's upper-ray regions to this
measure abstraction by creating a toy measure or bound functional where the
upper-ray bound itself is the measured value. That will provide a small
end-to-end test: upper-ray enlargement corresponds to numerical inequality, and
the `h <= epsilon` bound can be read as a region membership statement rather
than as an assumed conclusion.

## Milestone 9: Measured Toy Upper Rays

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/RegionMeasure.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyMeasuredComparison.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows the end of Step (xi) in the proof of IUT III, Corollary
3.12. In that passage, after applying the multiradial construction and passing
to the holomorphic hull, Mochizuki writes the comparison in terms of a real
upper-ray region of the form

```text
R_{<= -|log(Theta)|}
```

together with the real number `-|log(q)|`. The same passage emphasizes that the
log-volume is applied only after the region/hull and determinant operations have
made the objects comparable.

This is also aligned with the Scholze-Stix criticism: their discussion of
Corollary 3.12 stresses that one must spell out which copies of the real line are
being identified before deriving a real inequality. Our toy module therefore
keeps the labeled transport, target region, target volume, and final real
arithmetic inequality as separate Lean statements.

Mochizuki's recent formalization progress report describes the current RIMS
focus as the "3.11.5 => 3.12" simultaneous comparison relative to a common ring
structure, after moving the "hull+det" operation into the preceding stage. The
present milestone remains below that level: it only verifies the real upper-ray
and volume-calibration shape that such a later stage would have to feed.

### Purpose

The previous milestone introduced an abstract monotone `RegionMeasure`. This
milestone adds an explicit calibration property:

```text
RegionMeasure.NormalizesUpperRays measure
```

meaning that the measure of `Region.upperRay line bound` is exactly `bound`.
This is intentionally not part of the definition of a measure. It is a hypothesis
that must be supplied when a source-specific log-volume construction has been
proved to have this normalization.

### Lean Declarations

In `RegionMeasure.lean`:

```text
RegionMeasure.NormalizesUpperRays
RegionMeasure.upperRay_volume_eq_of_normalized
RegionMeasure.upperRay_volume_le_iff_of_normalized
RegionMeasure.upperRay_atMost_iff_of_normalized
```

These lemmas say that, under explicit upper-ray normalization, volume comparison
of upper rays is exactly comparison of their displayed bounds.

In `ToyMeasuredComparison.lean`:

```text
thetaIndeterminacy_target_subset_iff_epsilon_le
thetaIndeterminacy_targetVolume_eq_bound
thetaIndeterminacy_targetVolume_le_of_epsilon_le
thetaIndeterminacy_targetVolume_le_iff_epsilon_le
thetaIndeterminacy_holds_iff_coord_le_targetVolume
unitThetaIndeterminacy_coord_le_targetVolume_iff_bound
```

The first theorem says that enlarging the toy target region by increasing
`epsilon` is exactly region inclusion. The next two target-volume theorems say
that monotonicity gives one direction for arbitrary measures, and that the
converse is available only under the explicit upper-ray normalization. The final
two theorems connect target-region membership to the measured target bound and,
for the unit transport, recover the arithmetic statement `h <= epsilon`.

### What This Tests

The important test is the dependency structure:

1. Region inclusion follows from upper-ray arithmetic.
2. Volume inequality follows from region inclusion and measure monotonicity.
3. The reverse reading of volume inequality as an upper-ray bound requires the
   extra normalization hypothesis.
4. The toy `h <= epsilon` statement is recovered from target membership, not
   assumed as an input.

This is the kind of bookkeeping that Lean is useful for in the Corollary 3.12
discussion: if a later proof silently forgets a real-line identification,
normalization, or containment hypothesis, the theorem statement should stop
typechecking.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to define "log-volume of an upper ray" globally as its bound
and then use that as if it were already Mochizuki's analytic log-volume. Instead
we added only a named calibration hypothesis. The formalization now records
where the calibration is used.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce a small abstract interface for the
"hull+det" stage mentioned in Mochizuki's formalization report: an input region
family, a chosen common hull/determinant target, and a proof that applying a
normalized measure to that target yields a usable upper bound for every possible
output. This should still be abstract; no IUT-specific determinant construction
should be asserted before its source hypotheses are identified.
