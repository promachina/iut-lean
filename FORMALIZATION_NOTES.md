# Formalization Notes

These notes are the project diary and the seed of a later paper. Each Lean
milestone should be documented here in ordinary mathematical language: what was
formalized, why the definitions were chosen, what the Lean theorem actually says,
and what trap the design is meant to avoid.

## Method

We are treating Lean as a verification and disambiguation engine. The main rule
is that a Lean theorem should not contain the desired conclusion as a structure
field unless the theorem is explicitly marked as an interface placeholder. When
we introduce a placeholder, the research task is to replace it later by smaller
data and proofs.

This mirrors the "blueprint" style used in large Lean formalization projects:
human-readable mathematical text is kept synchronized with formal declarations.
Examples worth tracking are the Liquid Tensor Experiment blueprint
<https://leanprover-community.github.io/liquid/>, the Fermat's Last Theorem
blueprint <https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/FLT/blueprint/>, and recent
work on extracting blueprint data from Lean code in LeanArchitect
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22554>.

## Milestone 1: Labeled Real-Line Copies

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/RealLineCopy.lean`

### Purpose

The Scholze-Stix objection around IUT III, Corollary 3.12 is partly about
identifying several copies of one-dimensional ordered real vector spaces. Their
claim is that consistent identifications leave no room for the required `j^2`
scalings on the Theta side; inserting those scalars produces monodromy. Mochizuki's
position is that the Hodge-theater/log-link/multiradial apparatus makes some
comparisons legitimate precisely because the ring/scheme histories are not
silently identified.

Before formalizing log-volumes or pilot objects, we need a tiny discipline for
copies of the real line:

* a copy has a label;
* a point has a coordinate only relative to its copy;
* a comparison between copies is an explicit transport;
* a transport carries a positive scale, so it preserves the order orientation;
* a loop transport is trivial exactly when its scale is `1`.

This is intentionally much smaller than the IUT situation. Its job is to prevent
the first possible mistake: silently treating all real-number targets as the same
object.

### Lean Declarations

`RealLineCopy.Copy` is a labeled copy of the real line. Its only field is a
string label. This is not mathematically rich, but the label creates an explicit
place where later q-side, Theta-side, abstract-pilot, concrete-pilot, and
holomorphic-hull targets can differ.

`RealLineCopy.Point line` is a coordinate in a specific copy. The coordinate is a
plain real number, but the type records the copy to which the coordinate belongs.
This means a point of the q-copy is not definitionally a point of the Theta-copy.

`RealLineCopy.PositiveScale` is a real scalar with proof that it is positive. We
use positive scalars because the ordered real lines relevant to log-volume
comparisons should not be allowed to reverse order.

`RealLineCopy.Transport source target` is currently just a positive scaling from
one copy to another. Later this may be generalized to affine or abstract ordered
line isomorphisms if the mathematics requires it. For the first milestone,
positive scaling is exactly the structure needed to model identity comparison
versus scalar insertion.

`Transport.PointwiseEqual f g` means two transports induce the same coordinate
map on every point. The theorem
`Transport.pointwiseEqual_iff_scale_eq` proves that, for this model, pointwise
equality is equivalent to equality of scale factors.

`Transport.TrivialMonodromy f` means a loop transport is pointwise equal to the
identity transport. The theorem
`Transport.trivialMonodromy_iff_scale_eq_one` proves the core fact:

```text
a loop has trivial monodromy iff its scale is 1.
```

`Transport.scalarLoop_nontrivial_of_scale_ne_one` is the first formal expression
of the Scholze-Stix-style warning: if a scalar loop has scale not equal to `1`,
then it is not a trivial identification.

### What This Does Not Prove

This milestone does not prove anything about IUT, Corollary 3.12, q-pilots,
Theta-pilots, Frobenioids, Hodge theaters, or log-volumes.

It only proves a small control theorem for a future model: if we later insert a
`j^2` scaling into a closed comparison diagram, then we must either show that the
resulting loop is not meant to be trivial, or prove that the relevant
indeterminacy/hull operation changes the comparison relation. We cannot call it
an ordinary identity unless the scale is `1`.

### Design Trap Avoided

The dangerous shortcut would be to represent every log-volume target simply as
`Real`. That would erase the distinction between q-side and Theta-side real
coordinates before we have proved that such erasure is legitimate. This file does
the opposite: it makes every erasure or comparison pass through an explicit
transport.

## Milestone 2: Coherent Transport Diagrams

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/TransportDiagram.lean`

### Source Check

Before implementing this milestone, we rechecked the local primary texts.

Scholze-Stix say that, because the argument compares real numbers and several
ordered one-dimensional real vector spaces arise, it is critical to spell out all
identifications of copies of real numbers. In their diagnosis, adding `j^2`
scalars to the left side of the diagram produces monodromy; with consistent
identifications, those scalars must be omitted.

Mochizuki's IUT III, Remark 3.12.2, gives a toy model with two distinct labeled
copies `qR` and `ThetaR` of the real numbers. He emphasizes that forgetting the
distinct labels makes the assignments incompatible, while the labels and the
abstract symbol make simultaneous logical consideration possible. Later, an
assignment with indeterminacies is supposed to be intrinsically associated to the
q-side assignment even after the copies are identified.

Mochizuki's April 2026 progress report says that the Stage 1 Lean target should
focus on the simultaneous comparison of the q-pilot and Theta-pilot, with SHE
and IPL as part of the `3.11.5 => 3.12` package.

The formal move below captures only the elementary "consistent identification"
side of this discussion. It does not model the claimed indeterminacy/hull escape
route yet.

### Purpose

Milestone 1 handled a single loop. Milestone 2 handles two parallel comparison
paths between the same labeled real-line copies. This is closer to the diagrams
in the Scholze-Stix discussion: one path is a baseline comparison, while another
path is the same comparison with an extra scalar inserted.

The intended control theorem is:

```text
if a transport and its scalar-rescaled version form a coherent parallel diagram,
then the inserted scalar is 1.
```

Equivalently:

```text
if the inserted scalar is not 1, the parallel diagram is not coherent.
```

### Lean Declarations

`Transport.rescale s f` takes a transport `f` and multiplies its scale by the
positive scale `s`.

`Transport.ParallelPair source target` is a pair of parallel transports between
the same labeled copies.

`Transport.ParallelPair.Coherent p` means that the two paths are pointwise equal
as maps on coordinates.

`Transport.ParallelPair.coherent_iff_scale_eq` proves that, in this model,
coherence of parallel paths is equivalent to equality of their scale factors.

`Transport.coherent_rescale_iff_scale_eq_one` proves the central theorem of this
milestone:

```text
Coherent(f, rescale s f) iff s = 1.
```

`Transport.incoherent_rescale_of_scale_ne_one` packages the contrapositive:
nontrivial scalar insertion prevents coherence.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to define a "commutative diagram" as a proposition field and
then freely use it without understanding what it forces. Here we define
coherence as pointwise equality of transports, then prove Lean's reduction of
that condition to equality of scales. This keeps the mathematical content small
and inspectable.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce q-side and Theta-side log-volume assignments
as points in labeled real-line copies. Then we can express Mochizuki's toy model
directly:

```text
star |-> q(-h) in qR
star |-> Theta(-2h) in ThetaR
```

and separately express the indeterminacy version:

```text
star |-> Theta(R_{<= -2h + epsilon}) in ThetaR.
```

That will let us distinguish three things in Lean: labeled simultaneous
assignments, forced unlabeled identification, and comparison through an explicit
transport or indeterminacy relation.

## Milestone 3: The IUT III Toy Model

Lean file: `Iut/Stage1/ToyModel.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone is tied directly to IUT III, Remark 3.12.2, especially the
subparagraphs `(atoy)` through `(ftoy)`. Mochizuki describes two distinct labeled
copies `qR` and `ThetaR`, an abstract symbol `*`, and assignments

```text
lambda_q     : * |-> q(-h)        in qR
lambda_Theta : * |-> Theta(-2h)   in ThetaR.
```

He then says that if the labels `q` and `Theta` are forgotten, the assignments
become incompatible because `-h != -2h` for `h > 0`. He replaces the second
assignment by an indeterminacy version

```text
lambda_Theta^Ind : * |-> Theta(R_{<= -2h + epsilon})
```

and concludes formally that membership of `-h` in this region gives
`-h <= -2h + epsilon`, hence `h <= epsilon`.

This is also responsive to Scholze-Stix, who emphasize that all identifications
between the ordered one-dimensional real vector spaces must be spelled out. The
toy model is where we can spell out the smallest possible version of that issue.

### Lean Declarations

`ToyModel.qLine` and `ToyModel.thetaLine` are the two labeled copies.

`ToyModel.qAssignment h` is the point with coordinate `-h` in `qLine`.

`ToyModel.thetaAssignment h` is the point with coordinate `-2h` in `thetaLine`.

`ToyModel.ForcedUnlabeledEquality h` is the proposition obtained by forgetting
the two labels and asserting equality of the resulting coordinates in one
ambient copy of `Real`.

The theorem

```text
forcedUnlabeledEquality_iff_eq_zero
```

proves that this forced equality is equivalent to `h = 0`. The theorem

```text
forcedUnlabeledEquality_contradicts_positive
```

packages the expected contradiction for `h > 0`.

`ToyModel.thetaIndeterminacyRegion h epsilon x` is the coordinate predicate
`x <= -2h + epsilon`.

`ToyModel.QInThetaIndeterminacyAfterForgetting h epsilon` says that the
q-coordinate `-h` lies in this region after labels are forgotten.

The theorem

```text
qInThetaIndeterminacy_iff_bound
```

proves the exact arithmetic equivalence:

```text
-h in R_{<= -2h + epsilon}  iff  h <= epsilon.
```

### What This Tests

This milestone tests both sides of the toy-model passage.

First, the naive forced identification of the exact assignments is impossible
for positive `h`. This matches Mochizuki's own warning in `(atoy)` and the
Scholze-Stix insistence that identifications of real-line copies must be
tracked.

Second, the indeterminacy-region replacement has the advertised arithmetic
effect: once one has justified membership of `-h` in `R_{<= -2h + epsilon}`,
Lean confirms that the formal bound `h <= epsilon` follows.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to make the indeterminacy step a field such as
`bound : h <= epsilon`. We do not do that. We define the region membership
predicate and prove that the bound is equivalent to membership. The hard future
mathematics is therefore isolated: one must justify the membership, not the
bound directly.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect this toy model back to explicit transports:
instead of "forgetting labels" by immediately reading both coordinates in `Real`,
we should express comparison through a named transport from `qLine` to
`thetaLine`. This will let us ask whether a proposed comparison path is exact,
scalar-rescaled, or indeterminacy-valued.

## Milestone 4: Toy Model Through Named Transports

Lean file: `Iut/Stage1/ToyModel.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone continues the same source check as Milestone 3. The relevant
mathematical tension is:

* Mochizuki's toy model begins with distinct labeled copies `qR` and `ThetaR`.
* Forgetting the labels directly makes the exact assignments `-h` and `-2h`
  incompatible when `h > 0`.
* Scholze-Stix stress that every identification between ordered one-dimensional
  real vector spaces must be made explicit.

Milestone 4 implements the explicit-identification version: instead of simply
forgetting labels, we compare the q-assignment to the Theta-assignment through a
named positive-scale transport from `qLine` to `thetaLine`.

### Lean Declarations

`ToyModel.TransportedExactEquality f h` says that applying the named transport
`f : Transport qLine thetaLine` to the q-point `q(-h)` gives the exact Theta
point `Theta(-2h)`.

The theorem

```text
transportedExactEquality_iff_scale_eq_two
```

proves that, for `h != 0`, exact transported equality is equivalent to the
transport scale being `2`.

This is a useful normalization check. In the raw coordinate-forgetting model,
equality of `-h` and `-2h` forced `h = 0`. Once a named transport is allowed,
exact equality can be recovered, but only by making the transport carry the
nontrivial scale `2`.

`ToyModel.unitQToTheta` is the unit-scale transport from the q-line to the
Theta-line. The theorem

```text
unitQToTheta_not_transportedExactEquality
```

shows that this unit comparison cannot send `q(-h)` to `Theta(-2h)` when
`h > 0`.

The more general theorem

```text
transportedUnitEquality_contradicts_positive
```

says the same thing for any transport whose scale is `1`.

`ToyModel.TransportedQInThetaIndeterminacy f h epsilon` is the
transport-sensitive version of the indeterminacy-region membership. It says that
the transported q-coordinate lies in the Theta-side region
`R_{<= -2h + epsilon}`.

The theorem

```text
unitTransportedQInThetaIndeterminacy_iff_bound
```

checks that the unit-transport version recovers the arithmetic equivalence from
Milestone 3: membership is equivalent to `h <= epsilon`.

### What This Tests

The milestone separates three notions that must remain distinct in later work:

1. Raw label-forgetting.
2. Exact comparison through a named transport.
3. Indeterminacy-region comparison through a named transport.

This matters because a proof may legitimately compare two labeled copies only
after specifying the comparison map. The formal result here says that the
comparison map itself carries mathematical content: exact comparison of the toy
assignments forces a nontrivial scale.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to say "identify qR and ThetaR" without recording whether the
identification has scale `1`, scale `2`, scale `j^2`, or is not an exact
identification at all but an indeterminacy-valued relation. This milestone
forces that choice into Lean data.

### Next Step

The next milestone should stop treating indeterminacy as just a predicate on
coordinates and introduce a small abstract interface for indeterminacy-valued
relations between labeled real-line copies. The immediate goal is to distinguish
"pointwise equality" from "membership in a hull/region after transport" at the
type level.

## Milestone 5: Region-Valued Comparison Interface

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/IndeterminacyRelation.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyModel.lean`

### Source Check

The source texts repeatedly distinguish exact comparison from comparison up to
regions, hulls, and indeterminacies.

In IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, Mochizuki introduces holomorphic hulls of regions and
explains that passing to hulls is used to handle indeterminacies of possible
regions. In the proof of Corollary 3.12 and Remark 3.12.2, he describes the
Theta-pilot side as being represented only up to suitable indeterminacies. In
the toy model, this appears as replacing the exact assignment
`Theta(-2h)` by the region-valued assignment `Theta(R_{<= -2h + epsilon})`.

Scholze-Stix likewise focus on whether the claimed "blurring" by
indeterminacies is large enough to make the relevant diagrams commute. That
critique only makes sense if exact equality and indeterminacy-valued comparison
are kept separate.

### Purpose

The purpose of this milestone is to move the word "indeterminacy" out of
informal comments and into a small Lean interface. We still do not define IUT
hulls, Frobenioid objects, or log-volume hull-approximants. Instead, we define
the weakest useful target:

```text
a comparison sends a source point, through a named transport,
into a target-side region.
```

Exact equality is represented as the special case where the target region is a
singleton.

### Lean Declarations

`RealLineCopy.Region line` is a predicate on points of a labeled real-line copy.

`Region.singleton x` is the exact one-point region.

`Region.upperRay line bound` is the region of points whose coordinate is at most
`bound`. This is the concrete shape used by the toy model
`R_{<= -2h + epsilon}`.

`RegionComparison source target` packages a named transport from `source` to
`target` and a target-side region.

`RegionComparison.Holds comparison x` says that the transported image of `x`
lies in the target region.

`RegionComparison.exact transport targetPoint` is exact comparison as a
singleton-region comparison.

`RegionComparison.upperRay transport bound` is upper-ray comparison after a
named transport.

The foundational lemmas

```text
RegionComparison.exact_holds_iff
RegionComparison.upperRay_holds_iff
```

unfold the two cases to ordinary coordinate statements. These are intentionally
simple lemmas: they make it clear that the interface is not hiding extra
mathematics.

In the toy model, we added:

```text
exactThetaComparison
thetaIndeterminacyComparison
```

and checked that the new interface recovers the previous toy-model statements.
In particular:

```text
unitThetaIndeterminacyComparison_holds_iff_bound
```

still proves that the unit-transported q-point belongs to the Theta upper-ray
region if and only if `h <= epsilon`.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests that "exact equality" and "membership in a target region"
are different Lean objects. This matters for the central dispute: a future proof
cannot silently replace exact equality by a hull/indeterminacy comparison unless
it explicitly changes the target from a singleton region to a larger region and
then proves membership in that larger region.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to encode indeterminacy as an unstructured proposition such as
`blurred_commutes : Prop`, then use it as if it were equality. Here the target
side is visibly a `Region`, and equality is only the singleton-region special
case. If a later theorem needs a hull, it must say which region/hull is being
used.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce a minimal notion of monotonic enlargement
of regions. This is the first abstraction needed for "passing to a hull":
if a point lies in a region and the region is contained in a larger region, then
the point lies in the larger region. This should remain purely order-theoretic
and should not yet attempt to formalize holomorphic hulls.

## Milestone 6: Region Enlargement and Abstract Hulls

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/IndeterminacyRelation.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, especially the formal properties
listed for the hull map `phi : P -> H`:

```text
(P1) phi(H) = H for hulls H,
(P2) P subset phi(P),
(P3) P1 subset P2 implies phi(P1) subset phi(P2).
```

The immediate formal need for our project is only `(P2)` and `(P3)`: hulls
enlarge regions and are monotone with respect to inclusion. The same remark says
that compatibility with the preorder structure given by inclusion plays an
important role in log-volume estimates. Later parts of Remark 3.9.5 explain that
passing to hulls eliminates or absorbs certain indeterminacies of possible
regions.

The April 2026 formalization report also says that Stage 1 moves the
`hull+det` operation into the intermediate `3.11.5` package. That supports
formalizing the hull-facing interface before we attempt any real Frobenioid or
determinant content.

### Purpose

The goal is to capture the order-theoretic core of "passing to a hull" without
pretending to have formalized holomorphic hulls. We only need enough structure
to say:

```text
if a comparison lands in a region, then it also lands in any larger region;
if a hull operation is extensive, then a comparison lands in the hull
whenever it lands in the original region.
```

This is the next safe abstraction after Milestone 5's region-valued comparisons.

### Lean Declarations

`Region.Subset small large` is pointwise containment of regions.

`Region.ExtEq left right` is extensional equality of regions by pointwise
logical equivalence.

The basic lemmas are:

```text
Region.subset_refl
Region.subset_trans
Region.contains_of_subset
Region.extEq_of_subset_of_subset
```

`Region.singleton_subset_iff` says that a singleton region is contained in a
region iff the singleton's point belongs to that region. The proof is a small
sanity check on our representation of points: since regions are predicates on
points, not just on raw coordinates, Lean must reconstruct equality of points
from equality of their only coordinate.

`Region.upperRay_subset_upperRay` proves that upper rays are monotone in their
bound. The iff version,

```text
Region.upperRay_subset_upperRay_iff
```

shows that this condition is exact.

`HullOperator line` is an abstract hull operation with two fields:

```text
extensive : region subset hull(region)
monotone  : small subset large -> hull(small) subset hull(large)
```

This deliberately omits IUT's actual holomorphic definition. It records only the
part of Remark 3.9.5 that we can use without importing analytic or Frobenioid
machinery.

`RegionComparison.enlargeTarget` replaces the target region of a comparison by
a larger one.

`RegionComparison.holds_of_target_subset` proves that region comparison survives
target enlargement.

`RegionComparison.hullTarget` replaces the target region by its abstract hull.

`RegionComparison.holds_hullTarget` proves that a comparison into a region also
holds after replacing that target by its hull.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests the exact proof obligation created by "passing to a hull":
membership must be transported along an explicit inclusion. We now have a Lean
place to put future claims that a holomorphic hull contains the original possible
image region.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to introduce a function named `hull` and use it as if it
automatically preserved every comparison. Here a hull operation has to provide
the `extensive` field. If an alleged hull construction does not prove that the
original region is contained in the hull, Lean will not let us transfer
membership.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce bounded families of possible regions, still
abstractly. Remark 3.9.5 uses a hull associated to a bounded collection of
possible regions to remove dependence on a particular possible output of the
multiradial algorithm. A first Lean model should represent a family
`beta |-> P_beta` and a common target region that contains every `P_beta`.
