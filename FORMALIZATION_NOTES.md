# Formalization Notes

These notes are the project diary and the seed of a later paper. Each Lean
milestone should be documented here in ordinary mathematical language: what was
formalized, why the definitions were chosen, what the Lean theorem actually says,
and what trap the design is meant to avoid.

## Method

We are treating Lean as a verification and disambiguation engine. The main rule
is that a Lean theorem should not contain the desired conclusion as a structure
field unless the theorem is explicitly marked as an interface placeholder. When
we introduce a placeholder, the research task is to replace it later by smaller
data and proofs.

This mirrors the "blueprint" style used in large Lean formalization projects:
human-readable mathematical text is kept synchronized with formal declarations.
Examples worth tracking are the Liquid Tensor Experiment blueprint
<https://leanprover-community.github.io/liquid/>, the Fermat's Last Theorem
blueprint <https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/FLT/blueprint/>, and recent
work on extracting blueprint data from Lean code in LeanArchitect
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22554>.

## Milestone 1: Labeled Real-Line Copies

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/RealLineCopy.lean`

### Purpose

The Scholze-Stix objection around IUT III, Corollary 3.12 is partly about
identifying several copies of one-dimensional ordered real vector spaces. Their
claim is that consistent identifications leave no room for the required `j^2`
scalings on the Theta side; inserting those scalars produces monodromy. Mochizuki's
position is that the Hodge-theater/log-link/multiradial apparatus makes some
comparisons legitimate precisely because the ring/scheme histories are not
silently identified.

Before formalizing log-volumes or pilot objects, we need a tiny discipline for
copies of the real line:

* a copy has a label;
* a point has a coordinate only relative to its copy;
* a comparison between copies is an explicit transport;
* a transport carries a positive scale, so it preserves the order orientation;
* a loop transport is trivial exactly when its scale is `1`.

This is intentionally much smaller than the IUT situation. Its job is to prevent
the first possible mistake: silently treating all real-number targets as the same
object.

### Lean Declarations

`RealLineCopy.Copy` is a labeled copy of the real line. Its only field is a
string label. This is not mathematically rich, but the label creates an explicit
place where later q-side, Theta-side, abstract-pilot, concrete-pilot, and
holomorphic-hull targets can differ.

`RealLineCopy.Point line` is a coordinate in a specific copy. The coordinate is a
plain real number, but the type records the copy to which the coordinate belongs.
This means a point of the q-copy is not definitionally a point of the Theta-copy.

`RealLineCopy.PositiveScale` is a real scalar with proof that it is positive. We
use positive scalars because the ordered real lines relevant to log-volume
comparisons should not be allowed to reverse order.

`RealLineCopy.Transport source target` is currently just a positive scaling from
one copy to another. Later this may be generalized to affine or abstract ordered
line isomorphisms if the mathematics requires it. For the first milestone,
positive scaling is exactly the structure needed to model identity comparison
versus scalar insertion.

`Transport.PointwiseEqual f g` means two transports induce the same coordinate
map on every point. The theorem
`Transport.pointwiseEqual_iff_scale_eq` proves that, for this model, pointwise
equality is equivalent to equality of scale factors.

`Transport.TrivialMonodromy f` means a loop transport is pointwise equal to the
identity transport. The theorem
`Transport.trivialMonodromy_iff_scale_eq_one` proves the core fact:

```text
a loop has trivial monodromy iff its scale is 1.
```

`Transport.scalarLoop_nontrivial_of_scale_ne_one` is the first formal expression
of the Scholze-Stix-style warning: if a scalar loop has scale not equal to `1`,
then it is not a trivial identification.

### What This Does Not Prove

This milestone does not prove anything about IUT, Corollary 3.12, q-pilots,
Theta-pilots, Frobenioids, Hodge theaters, or log-volumes.

It only proves a small control theorem for a future model: if we later insert a
`j^2` scaling into a closed comparison diagram, then we must either show that the
resulting loop is not meant to be trivial, or prove that the relevant
indeterminacy/hull operation changes the comparison relation. We cannot call it
an ordinary identity unless the scale is `1`.

### Design Trap Avoided

The dangerous shortcut would be to represent every log-volume target simply as
`Real`. That would erase the distinction between q-side and Theta-side real
coordinates before we have proved that such erasure is legitimate. This file does
the opposite: it makes every erasure or comparison pass through an explicit
transport.

## Milestone 2: Coherent Transport Diagrams

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/TransportDiagram.lean`

### Source Check

Before implementing this milestone, we rechecked the local primary texts.

Scholze-Stix say that, because the argument compares real numbers and several
ordered one-dimensional real vector spaces arise, it is critical to spell out all
identifications of copies of real numbers. In their diagnosis, adding `j^2`
scalars to the left side of the diagram produces monodromy; with consistent
identifications, those scalars must be omitted.

Mochizuki's IUT III, Remark 3.12.2, gives a toy model with two distinct labeled
copies `qR` and `ThetaR` of the real numbers. He emphasizes that forgetting the
distinct labels makes the assignments incompatible, while the labels and the
abstract symbol make simultaneous logical consideration possible. Later, an
assignment with indeterminacies is supposed to be intrinsically associated to the
q-side assignment even after the copies are identified.

Mochizuki's April 2026 progress report says that the Stage 1 Lean target should
focus on the simultaneous comparison of the q-pilot and Theta-pilot, with SHE
and IPL as part of the `3.11.5 => 3.12` package.

The formal move below captures only the elementary "consistent identification"
side of this discussion. It does not model the claimed indeterminacy/hull escape
route yet.

### Purpose

Milestone 1 handled a single loop. Milestone 2 handles two parallel comparison
paths between the same labeled real-line copies. This is closer to the diagrams
in the Scholze-Stix discussion: one path is a baseline comparison, while another
path is the same comparison with an extra scalar inserted.

The intended control theorem is:

```text
if a transport and its scalar-rescaled version form a coherent parallel diagram,
then the inserted scalar is 1.
```

Equivalently:

```text
if the inserted scalar is not 1, the parallel diagram is not coherent.
```

### Lean Declarations

`Transport.rescale s f` takes a transport `f` and multiplies its scale by the
positive scale `s`.

`Transport.ParallelPair source target` is a pair of parallel transports between
the same labeled copies.

`Transport.ParallelPair.Coherent p` means that the two paths are pointwise equal
as maps on coordinates.

`Transport.ParallelPair.coherent_iff_scale_eq` proves that, in this model,
coherence of parallel paths is equivalent to equality of their scale factors.

`Transport.coherent_rescale_iff_scale_eq_one` proves the central theorem of this
milestone:

```text
Coherent(f, rescale s f) iff s = 1.
```

`Transport.incoherent_rescale_of_scale_ne_one` packages the contrapositive:
nontrivial scalar insertion prevents coherence.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to define a "commutative diagram" as a proposition field and
then freely use it without understanding what it forces. Here we define
coherence as pointwise equality of transports, then prove Lean's reduction of
that condition to equality of scales. This keeps the mathematical content small
and inspectable.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce q-side and Theta-side log-volume assignments
as points in labeled real-line copies. Then we can express Mochizuki's toy model
directly:

```text
star |-> q(-h) in qR
star |-> Theta(-2h) in ThetaR
```

and separately express the indeterminacy version:

```text
star |-> Theta(R_{<= -2h + epsilon}) in ThetaR.
```

That will let us distinguish three things in Lean: labeled simultaneous
assignments, forced unlabeled identification, and comparison through an explicit
transport or indeterminacy relation.

## Milestone 3: The IUT III Toy Model

Lean file: `Iut/Stage1/ToyModel.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone is tied directly to IUT III, Remark 3.12.2, especially the
subparagraphs `(atoy)` through `(ftoy)`. Mochizuki describes two distinct labeled
copies `qR` and `ThetaR`, an abstract symbol `*`, and assignments

```text
lambda_q     : * |-> q(-h)        in qR
lambda_Theta : * |-> Theta(-2h)   in ThetaR.
```

He then says that if the labels `q` and `Theta` are forgotten, the assignments
become incompatible because `-h != -2h` for `h > 0`. He replaces the second
assignment by an indeterminacy version

```text
lambda_Theta^Ind : * |-> Theta(R_{<= -2h + epsilon})
```

and concludes formally that membership of `-h` in this region gives
`-h <= -2h + epsilon`, hence `h <= epsilon`.

This is also responsive to Scholze-Stix, who emphasize that all identifications
between the ordered one-dimensional real vector spaces must be spelled out. The
toy model is where we can spell out the smallest possible version of that issue.

### Lean Declarations

`ToyModel.qLine` and `ToyModel.thetaLine` are the two labeled copies.

`ToyModel.qAssignment h` is the point with coordinate `-h` in `qLine`.

`ToyModel.thetaAssignment h` is the point with coordinate `-2h` in `thetaLine`.

`ToyModel.ForcedUnlabeledEquality h` is the proposition obtained by forgetting
the two labels and asserting equality of the resulting coordinates in one
ambient copy of `Real`.

The theorem

```text
forcedUnlabeledEquality_iff_eq_zero
```

proves that this forced equality is equivalent to `h = 0`. The theorem

```text
forcedUnlabeledEquality_contradicts_positive
```

packages the expected contradiction for `h > 0`.

`ToyModel.thetaIndeterminacyRegion h epsilon x` is the coordinate predicate
`x <= -2h + epsilon`.

`ToyModel.QInThetaIndeterminacyAfterForgetting h epsilon` says that the
q-coordinate `-h` lies in this region after labels are forgotten.

The theorem

```text
qInThetaIndeterminacy_iff_bound
```

proves the exact arithmetic equivalence:

```text
-h in R_{<= -2h + epsilon}  iff  h <= epsilon.
```

### What This Tests

This milestone tests both sides of the toy-model passage.

First, the naive forced identification of the exact assignments is impossible
for positive `h`. This matches Mochizuki's own warning in `(atoy)` and the
Scholze-Stix insistence that identifications of real-line copies must be
tracked.

Second, the indeterminacy-region replacement has the advertised arithmetic
effect: once one has justified membership of `-h` in `R_{<= -2h + epsilon}`,
Lean confirms that the formal bound `h <= epsilon` follows.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to make the indeterminacy step a field such as
`bound : h <= epsilon`. We do not do that. We define the region membership
predicate and prove that the bound is equivalent to membership. The hard future
mathematics is therefore isolated: one must justify the membership, not the
bound directly.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect this toy model back to explicit transports:
instead of "forgetting labels" by immediately reading both coordinates in `Real`,
we should express comparison through a named transport from `qLine` to
`thetaLine`. This will let us ask whether a proposed comparison path is exact,
scalar-rescaled, or indeterminacy-valued.

## Milestone 4: Toy Model Through Named Transports

Lean file: `Iut/Stage1/ToyModel.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone continues the same source check as Milestone 3. The relevant
mathematical tension is:

* Mochizuki's toy model begins with distinct labeled copies `qR` and `ThetaR`.
* Forgetting the labels directly makes the exact assignments `-h` and `-2h`
  incompatible when `h > 0`.
* Scholze-Stix stress that every identification between ordered one-dimensional
  real vector spaces must be made explicit.

Milestone 4 implements the explicit-identification version: instead of simply
forgetting labels, we compare the q-assignment to the Theta-assignment through a
named positive-scale transport from `qLine` to `thetaLine`.

### Lean Declarations

`ToyModel.TransportedExactEquality f h` says that applying the named transport
`f : Transport qLine thetaLine` to the q-point `q(-h)` gives the exact Theta
point `Theta(-2h)`.

The theorem

```text
transportedExactEquality_iff_scale_eq_two
```

proves that, for `h != 0`, exact transported equality is equivalent to the
transport scale being `2`.

This is a useful normalization check. In the raw coordinate-forgetting model,
equality of `-h` and `-2h` forced `h = 0`. Once a named transport is allowed,
exact equality can be recovered, but only by making the transport carry the
nontrivial scale `2`.

`ToyModel.unitQToTheta` is the unit-scale transport from the q-line to the
Theta-line. The theorem

```text
unitQToTheta_not_transportedExactEquality
```

shows that this unit comparison cannot send `q(-h)` to `Theta(-2h)` when
`h > 0`.

The more general theorem

```text
transportedUnitEquality_contradicts_positive
```

says the same thing for any transport whose scale is `1`.

`ToyModel.TransportedQInThetaIndeterminacy f h epsilon` is the
transport-sensitive version of the indeterminacy-region membership. It says that
the transported q-coordinate lies in the Theta-side region
`R_{<= -2h + epsilon}`.

The theorem

```text
unitTransportedQInThetaIndeterminacy_iff_bound
```

checks that the unit-transport version recovers the arithmetic equivalence from
Milestone 3: membership is equivalent to `h <= epsilon`.

### What This Tests

The milestone separates three notions that must remain distinct in later work:

1. Raw label-forgetting.
2. Exact comparison through a named transport.
3. Indeterminacy-region comparison through a named transport.

This matters because a proof may legitimately compare two labeled copies only
after specifying the comparison map. The formal result here says that the
comparison map itself carries mathematical content: exact comparison of the toy
assignments forces a nontrivial scale.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to say "identify qR and ThetaR" without recording whether the
identification has scale `1`, scale `2`, scale `j^2`, or is not an exact
identification at all but an indeterminacy-valued relation. This milestone
forces that choice into Lean data.

### Next Step

The next milestone should stop treating indeterminacy as just a predicate on
coordinates and introduce a small abstract interface for indeterminacy-valued
relations between labeled real-line copies. The immediate goal is to distinguish
"pointwise equality" from "membership in a hull/region after transport" at the
type level.

## Milestone 5: Region-Valued Comparison Interface

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/IndeterminacyRelation.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyModel.lean`

### Source Check

The source texts repeatedly distinguish exact comparison from comparison up to
regions, hulls, and indeterminacies.

In IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, Mochizuki introduces holomorphic hulls of regions and
explains that passing to hulls is used to handle indeterminacies of possible
regions. In the proof of Corollary 3.12 and Remark 3.12.2, he describes the
Theta-pilot side as being represented only up to suitable indeterminacies. In
the toy model, this appears as replacing the exact assignment
`Theta(-2h)` by the region-valued assignment `Theta(R_{<= -2h + epsilon})`.

Scholze-Stix likewise focus on whether the claimed "blurring" by
indeterminacies is large enough to make the relevant diagrams commute. That
critique only makes sense if exact equality and indeterminacy-valued comparison
are kept separate.

### Purpose

The purpose of this milestone is to move the word "indeterminacy" out of
informal comments and into a small Lean interface. We still do not define IUT
hulls, Frobenioid objects, or log-volume hull-approximants. Instead, we define
the weakest useful target:

```text
a comparison sends a source point, through a named transport,
into a target-side region.
```

Exact equality is represented as the special case where the target region is a
singleton.

### Lean Declarations

`RealLineCopy.Region line` is a predicate on points of a labeled real-line copy.

`Region.singleton x` is the exact one-point region.

`Region.upperRay line bound` is the region of points whose coordinate is at most
`bound`. This is the concrete shape used by the toy model
`R_{<= -2h + epsilon}`.

`RegionComparison source target` packages a named transport from `source` to
`target` and a target-side region.

`RegionComparison.Holds comparison x` says that the transported image of `x`
lies in the target region.

`RegionComparison.exact transport targetPoint` is exact comparison as a
singleton-region comparison.

`RegionComparison.upperRay transport bound` is upper-ray comparison after a
named transport.

The foundational lemmas

```text
RegionComparison.exact_holds_iff
RegionComparison.upperRay_holds_iff
```

unfold the two cases to ordinary coordinate statements. These are intentionally
simple lemmas: they make it clear that the interface is not hiding extra
mathematics.

In the toy model, we added:

```text
exactThetaComparison
thetaIndeterminacyComparison
```

and checked that the new interface recovers the previous toy-model statements.
In particular:

```text
unitThetaIndeterminacyComparison_holds_iff_bound
```

still proves that the unit-transported q-point belongs to the Theta upper-ray
region if and only if `h <= epsilon`.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests that "exact equality" and "membership in a target region"
are different Lean objects. This matters for the central dispute: a future proof
cannot silently replace exact equality by a hull/indeterminacy comparison unless
it explicitly changes the target from a singleton region to a larger region and
then proves membership in that larger region.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to encode indeterminacy as an unstructured proposition such as
`blurred_commutes : Prop`, then use it as if it were equality. Here the target
side is visibly a `Region`, and equality is only the singleton-region special
case. If a later theorem needs a hull, it must say which region/hull is being
used.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce a minimal notion of monotonic enlargement
of regions. This is the first abstraction needed for "passing to a hull":
if a point lies in a region and the region is contained in a larger region, then
the point lies in the larger region. This should remain purely order-theoretic
and should not yet attempt to formalize holomorphic hulls.

## Milestone 6: Region Enlargement and Abstract Hulls

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/IndeterminacyRelation.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, especially the formal properties
listed for the hull map `phi : P -> H`:

```text
(P1) phi(H) = H for hulls H,
(P2) P subset phi(P),
(P3) P1 subset P2 implies phi(P1) subset phi(P2).
```

The immediate formal need for our project is only `(P2)` and `(P3)`: hulls
enlarge regions and are monotone with respect to inclusion. The same remark says
that compatibility with the preorder structure given by inclusion plays an
important role in log-volume estimates. Later parts of Remark 3.9.5 explain that
passing to hulls eliminates or absorbs certain indeterminacies of possible
regions.

The April 2026 formalization report also says that Stage 1 moves the
`hull+det` operation into the intermediate `3.11.5` package. That supports
formalizing the hull-facing interface before we attempt any real Frobenioid or
determinant content.

### Purpose

The goal is to capture the order-theoretic core of "passing to a hull" without
pretending to have formalized holomorphic hulls. We only need enough structure
to say:

```text
if a comparison lands in a region, then it also lands in any larger region;
if a hull operation is extensive, then a comparison lands in the hull
whenever it lands in the original region.
```

This is the next safe abstraction after Milestone 5's region-valued comparisons.

### Lean Declarations

`Region.Subset small large` is pointwise containment of regions.

`Region.ExtEq left right` is extensional equality of regions by pointwise
logical equivalence.

The basic lemmas are:

```text
Region.subset_refl
Region.subset_trans
Region.contains_of_subset
Region.extEq_of_subset_of_subset
```

`Region.singleton_subset_iff` says that a singleton region is contained in a
region iff the singleton's point belongs to that region. The proof is a small
sanity check on our representation of points: since regions are predicates on
points, not just on raw coordinates, Lean must reconstruct equality of points
from equality of their only coordinate.

`Region.upperRay_subset_upperRay` proves that upper rays are monotone in their
bound. The iff version,

```text
Region.upperRay_subset_upperRay_iff
```

shows that this condition is exact.

`HullOperator line` is an abstract hull operation with two fields:

```text
extensive : region subset hull(region)
monotone  : small subset large -> hull(small) subset hull(large)
```

This deliberately omits IUT's actual holomorphic definition. It records only the
part of Remark 3.9.5 that we can use without importing analytic or Frobenioid
machinery.

`RegionComparison.enlargeTarget` replaces the target region of a comparison by
a larger one.

`RegionComparison.holds_of_target_subset` proves that region comparison survives
target enlargement.

`RegionComparison.hullTarget` replaces the target region by its abstract hull.

`RegionComparison.holds_hullTarget` proves that a comparison into a region also
holds after replacing that target by its hull.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests the exact proof obligation created by "passing to a hull":
membership must be transported along an explicit inclusion. We now have a Lean
place to put future claims that a holomorphic hull contains the original possible
image region.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to introduce a function named `hull` and use it as if it
automatically preserved every comparison. Here a hull operation has to provide
the `extensive` field. If an alleged hull construction does not prove that the
original region is contained in the hull, Lean will not let us transfer
membership.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce bounded families of possible regions, still
abstractly. Remark 3.9.5 uses a hull associated to a bounded collection of
possible regions to remove dependence on a particular possible output of the
multiradial algorithm. A first Lean model should represent a family
`beta |-> P_beta` and a common target region that contains every `P_beta`.

## Milestone 7: Families of Possible Regions

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/IndeterminacyRelation.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows the final part of IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, (vi), and
Remark 3.9.5, (vii), (Ob5). Mochizuki says that the discussion applies not only
to one region `P`, but also to bounded families

```text
P_B = { P_beta }_{beta in B}
```

and then describes a hull `phi(P_B)` associated to the family. In (Ob5), he
describes the choice of a specific possible region in the output of the
multiradial algorithm as internal to the algorithm; comparison with an external
object such as the q-pilot side should therefore use an object independent of
that specific choice, namely the hull associated to the collection of possible
regions.

This is also the place where the April 2026 progress report's phrase
"gluings up to indeterminacies" becomes relevant. A family of possible target
regions is the minimal formal container for such an indeterminacy of choices.

### Purpose

The goal is to represent the following pattern:

```text
for every choice beta, there is a possible region P_beta;
a common target region C contains every P_beta;
therefore, membership in any chosen P_beta implies membership in C.
```

This is the order-theoretic core of removing dependence on the particular
possible output chosen by an algorithm.

We still do not formalize boundedness, compactness, relative compactness,
log-volume, or the actual analytic construction of `phi(P_B)`. Those are future
milestones. The current milestone only records the containment structure that
later facts must satisfy.

### Lean Declarations

`RegionFamily line index` is a family of regions indexed by a type of choices.

`RegionFamily.ContainedIn family common` says that every region in the family is
contained in a common region.

`RegionFamily.contains_common_of_contains_choice` proves that if a point belongs
to a chosen possible region, and all possible regions are contained in a common
region, then the point belongs to the common region.

`RegionFamily.CommonHull family` packages a common region together with the
proof that it contains every possible region in the family. This is the abstract
shape of `phi(P_B)` for now.

`RegionFamily.CommonHull.enlarge` says that a larger region than a common hull
is again a common hull. This is a basic closure property needed for later
passes through coarser hulls or quotients.

`RegionComparisonFamily source target index` is a family of region comparisons.
This represents possible comparison outputs, all with the same source and target
copies but with possibly different target regions.

`RegionComparisonFamily.targetRegions` extracts the underlying family of target
regions.

`RegionComparisonFamily.CommonTarget family common` says that `common` contains
all target regions of the comparison family.

Theorems:

```text
holds_commonTarget_of_choice
holds_commonTargetHull_of_choice
```

say that if a chosen comparison holds, then it also holds after replacing that
chosen target region by a common target or common target hull.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests the exact logical step from "one of the possible regions
was chosen" to "we may work in a common region independent of the choice." The
proof is deliberately elementary: it is just membership transfer along inclusion.

That is useful because future IUT-specific work must supply the nontrivial
premise: that the proposed hull or common target really contains every possible
region generated by the multiradial algorithm.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to model an indeterminate algorithmic output as a single
region too early. That would erase the choice-dependence that Remark 3.9.5,
(Ob5), explicitly says must be handled. We now represent the choice-dependence
as an indexed family and require a proof before replacing it by a common target.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce a first log-volume abstraction over regions.
It should not try to define the analytic log-volume. It should only express the
monotonicity shape needed for upper-ray toy regions and later hull estimates:
when `small subset large`, the chosen numerical measure is ordered in the
appropriate direction.

## Milestone 8: Abstract Region Measures

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/RegionMeasure.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows IUT III, Remark 3.9.5, where log-volume estimates are
discussed in the presence of hulls and possible regions. The relevant source
pattern is:

```text
mu_log(phi(P)) >= mu_log(H) >= mu_log(P)
```

for hull-approximants `H` associated to a region `P`, together with the
discussion in (Ob6) that one is ultimately interested in estimating log-volumes
but cannot simply replace the region-level construction by log-volumes too
early.

The proof of Corollary 3.12 also says that log-volumes are invariant under some
indeterminacies and convert the upper semi-compatibility indeterminacy `(Ind3)`
into an inequality from above. That is a later target. For this milestone we
only encode the monotonicity shape of region inclusion.

### Purpose

The goal is to introduce a numerical layer without pretending to define IUT
log-volume. We need a controlled interface that can support statements of the
form:

```text
small subset large  ->  volume(small) <= volume(large)
```

and then derive the consequences for hulls and common targets.

This keeps the formalization honest: if later we introduce an actual IUT
log-volume, it will have to instantiate this interface by proving monotonicity.

### Lean Declarations

`RegionMeasure line` is a real-valued function on regions of a labeled real-line
copy, together with a monotonicity proof.

Core lemmas:

```text
RegionMeasure.le_of_subset
RegionMeasure.le_hull
RegionMeasure.le_common_of_choice
RegionMeasure.le_commonHull_of_choice
```

These say that volumes are monotone under ordinary inclusion, passage to an
abstract hull, and passage from any chosen possible region to a common region or
common hull.

`RegionMeasure.HasVolumeAtMost measure region bound` is the proposition
`volume(region) <= bound`.

The theorem

```text
RegionMeasure.atMost_of_subset_of_atMost
```

says that an upper bound on a larger region gives an upper bound on any
contained smaller region. This is the direction needed when an estimate is
proved for a hull/common target and then applied to a specific possible region.

The theorem

```text
RegionMeasure.choice_atMost_of_common_atMost
```

specializes this to a family of possible regions contained in a common target.

For region comparisons, `RegionMeasure.targetVolume` measures the target region
of a comparison. The lemmas

```text
RegionMeasure.targetVolume_le_enlarge
RegionMeasure.targetVolume_le_hullTarget
RegionMeasure.choice_targetVolume_le_common
RegionMeasure.choice_targetVolume_le_commonHull
```

transfer the same monotonicity facts to comparison targets.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests that the numerical estimate layer depends only on explicit
containment hypotheses. No volume inequality is available merely because a
region is called a hull or an indeterminacy region. Lean requires the inclusion
or hull-extensiveness proof.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to make "log-volume" a magic function with the inequalities
needed for Corollary 3.12 already built into theorem statements. Here the only
built-in property is monotonicity under inclusion. This is intentionally too
weak to prove IUT-level conclusions by itself.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect the toy model's upper-ray regions to this
measure abstraction by creating a toy measure or bound functional where the
upper-ray bound itself is the measured value. That will provide a small
end-to-end test: upper-ray enlargement corresponds to numerical inequality, and
the `h <= epsilon` bound can be read as a region membership statement rather
than as an assumed conclusion.

## Milestone 9: Measured Toy Upper Rays

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/RegionMeasure.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyMeasuredComparison.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows the end of Step (xi) in the proof of IUT III, Corollary
3.12. In that passage, after applying the multiradial construction and passing
to the holomorphic hull, Mochizuki writes the comparison in terms of a real
upper-ray region of the form

```text
R_{<= -|log(Theta)|}
```

together with the real number `-|log(q)|`. The same passage emphasizes that the
log-volume is applied only after the region/hull and determinant operations have
made the objects comparable.

This is also aligned with the Scholze-Stix criticism: their discussion of
Corollary 3.12 stresses that one must spell out which copies of the real line are
being identified before deriving a real inequality. Our toy module therefore
keeps the labeled transport, target region, target volume, and final real
arithmetic inequality as separate Lean statements.

Mochizuki's recent formalization progress report describes the current RIMS
focus as the "3.11.5 => 3.12" simultaneous comparison relative to a common ring
structure, after moving the "hull+det" operation into the preceding stage. The
present milestone remains below that level: it only verifies the real upper-ray
and volume-calibration shape that such a later stage would have to feed.

### Purpose

The previous milestone introduced an abstract monotone `RegionMeasure`. This
milestone adds an explicit calibration property:

```text
RegionMeasure.NormalizesUpperRays measure
```

meaning that the measure of `Region.upperRay line bound` is exactly `bound`.
This is intentionally not part of the definition of a measure. It is a hypothesis
that must be supplied when a source-specific log-volume construction has been
proved to have this normalization.

### Lean Declarations

In `RegionMeasure.lean`:

```text
RegionMeasure.NormalizesUpperRays
RegionMeasure.upperRay_volume_eq_of_normalized
RegionMeasure.upperRay_volume_le_iff_of_normalized
RegionMeasure.upperRay_atMost_iff_of_normalized
```

These lemmas say that, under explicit upper-ray normalization, volume comparison
of upper rays is exactly comparison of their displayed bounds.

In `ToyMeasuredComparison.lean`:

```text
thetaIndeterminacy_target_subset_iff_epsilon_le
thetaIndeterminacy_targetVolume_eq_bound
thetaIndeterminacy_targetVolume_le_of_epsilon_le
thetaIndeterminacy_targetVolume_le_iff_epsilon_le
thetaIndeterminacy_holds_iff_coord_le_targetVolume
unitThetaIndeterminacy_coord_le_targetVolume_iff_bound
```

The first theorem says that enlarging the toy target region by increasing
`epsilon` is exactly region inclusion. The next two target-volume theorems say
that monotonicity gives one direction for arbitrary measures, and that the
converse is available only under the explicit upper-ray normalization. The final
two theorems connect target-region membership to the measured target bound and,
for the unit transport, recover the arithmetic statement `h <= epsilon`.

### What This Tests

The important test is the dependency structure:

1. Region inclusion follows from upper-ray arithmetic.
2. Volume inequality follows from region inclusion and measure monotonicity.
3. The reverse reading of volume inequality as an upper-ray bound requires the
   extra normalization hypothesis.
4. The toy `h <= epsilon` statement is recovered from target membership, not
   assumed as an input.

This is the kind of bookkeeping that Lean is useful for in the Corollary 3.12
discussion: if a later proof silently forgets a real-line identification,
normalization, or containment hypothesis, the theorem statement should stop
typechecking.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to define "log-volume of an upper ray" globally as its bound
and then use that as if it were already Mochizuki's analytic log-volume. Instead
we added only a named calibration hypothesis. The formalization now records
where the calibration is used.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce a small abstract interface for the
"hull+det" stage mentioned in Mochizuki's formalization report: an input region
family, a chosen common hull/determinant target, and a proof that applying a
normalized measure to that target yields a usable upper bound for every possible
output. This should still be abstract; no IUT-specific determinant construction
should be asserted before its source hypotheses are identified.

## Milestone 10: Measured Common-Target Bounds

Lean file: `Iut/Foundations/CommonTargetBound.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows the same Step (xi) portion of IUT III, Corollary 3.12
used in the previous milestone, but now records the family-level shape. The
source passage says that the multiradial construction, followed by formation of
the holomorphic hull, yields a collection of possible output data, and that only
after forming a suitable determinant and applying normalized log-volume do the
Theta-side region and the q-pilot log-volume become comparable real objects.

The introduction to IUT III describes this as the log-volume of the holomorphic
hull of the union of possible images of the Theta-pilot object, computed in
terms of the q-pilot object. Mochizuki's recent formalization progress report
describes a reorganization in which the "hull+det" operation is moved into an
intermediate "3.11.5" stage, leaving the final "3.11.5 => 3.12" step as a
simultaneous comparison in a common container. Scholze-Stix, in their critique,
stress the same danger from the opposite direction: a real inequality is only
meaningful after the relevant copies of real ordered one-dimensional spaces and
their identifications have been made explicit.

### Purpose

The existing `RegionComparisonFamily.CommonTargetHull` says only that every
possible target region is contained in a common hull. The existing
`RegionMeasure` says only that volume is monotone under containment. This
milestone packages the exact additional data needed to pass from those two
facts to a family-wide upper bound:

```text
common target contains every possible target
volume(common target) <= bound
```

No construction of the common target is included. In IUT terms, the future
formalization of APT/IPL/SHE plus hull+det must produce this package.

### Lean Declarations

`RegionComparisonFamily.AllTargetsAtMost measure family bound` is the direct
conclusion:

```text
forall choice, targetVolume(choice) <= bound
```

`RegionComparisonFamily.CommonTargetBound measure family bound` stores:

```text
common        : Region target
contains_each : family.CommonTarget common
volume_bound  : HasVolumeAtMost measure common bound
```

`RegionComparisonFamily.CommonTargetHullBound measure family bound` is the same
package specialized to an existing `family.CommonTargetHull`.

For both packages, Lean proves:

```text
choice_targetVolume_le
allTargetsAtMost
choice_region_atMost
weakenBound
```

The common-target package also proves `holds_common_of_choice`; the hull package
proves `holds_commonHull_of_choice`. These keep membership transport separate
from the numerical estimate.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests the intended proof dependency:

1. A chosen possible output lies in its target region.
2. The common target/hull contains every possible target region.
3. A measure bound is known for the common target/hull.
4. Therefore every chosen target has volume at most the same bound.

Lean enforces that the fourth item cannot be obtained from the name "hull" or
"determinant" alone. It needs the containment and measured-bound fields.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to introduce a theorem named after Corollary 3.12 that simply
assumes the final inequality. This module does not mention q-pilots, Theta-
pilots, or ABC. It only records the common-target upper-bound mechanism that a
future IUT-specific construction must instantiate.

### Next Step

The next milestone should instantiate this common-target package for a toy
family of upper-ray comparisons. That will give a concrete Lean test that a
single common upper-ray bound controls all choices in a family, while still
requiring explicit containment proofs for each possible output.

## Milestone 11: Toy Family Bounds

Lean file: `Iut/Stage1/ToyFamilyBounds.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone is a toy instantiation of the family-level pattern in IUT III,
Corollary 3.12, Step (xi). The relevant source language is that Theorem 3.11,
followed by formation of the holomorphic hull, yields a collection of possible
output data; only after determinant formation and normalized log-volume are the
resulting Theta-side region and the q-pilot log-volume comparable as real
objects.

Mochizuki's formalization progress report describes the same region of the
argument as the move from APT/IPL/SHE plus "hull+det" to the final simultaneous
comparison. Scholze-Stix emphasize that the real comparison must not hide
identifications of copies of ordered real vector spaces. Our toy family therefore
uses one fixed labeled target line `thetaLine`, one explicit transport, and an
explicit cap on all possible epsilon values.

### Purpose

The previous milestone introduced the abstract package:

```text
CommonTargetBound = common target + containment + measured upper bound
```

This milestone verifies that the package behaves as intended in the toy
upper-ray setting. A family of possible outputs is represented by a function

```text
epsilon : index -> Real
```

and each choice gives the target region

```text
R_{<= -2h + epsilon choice}
```

A single cap `epsilonBound`, together with the hypothesis

```text
forall choice, epsilon choice <= epsilonBound
```

produces the common target

```text
R_{<= -2h + epsilonBound}
```

### Lean Declarations

`thetaIndeterminacyFamily f h epsilon` is a `RegionComparisonFamily` whose
chosen comparison is `thetaIndeterminacyComparison f h (epsilon choice)`.

`thetaIndeterminacyCommonTarget h epsilonBound` is the common upper ray with
bound `-2h + epsilonBound`.

The theorem

```text
thetaIndeterminacyFamily_commonTarget
```

turns the pointwise epsilon cap into a proof that the family is contained in the
common target.

The definition

```text
thetaIndeterminacyCommonTargetBound
```

builds a `RegionComparisonFamily.CommonTargetBound` under the explicit
upper-ray normalization hypothesis on the measure.

The theorems

```text
thetaIndeterminacyFamily_allTargetsAtMost
thetaIndeterminacyFamily_choice_targetVolume_le_bound
thetaIndeterminacyFamily_choice_holds_common
```

extract the family-wide bound, the chosen target-volume bound, and the chosen
membership transfer into the common target.

Finally,

```text
unitThetaIndeterminacyFamily_choice_holds_iff_bound
unitThetaIndeterminacyFamily_bound_of_choice_holds
```

show that, for the unit transport toy case, membership in a chosen possible
target gives `h <= epsilon choice`, and the common cap gives `h <= epsilonBound`.

### What This Tests

This is the first end-to-end family test:

1. Possible outputs remain indexed by an explicit choice type.
2. A common target is available only from a pointwise cap proof.
3. A measured family bound is available only after adding upper-ray
   normalization.
4. The arithmetic conclusion for the unit toy transport factors through the
   chosen output and then through the common cap.

This matches the project discipline for the Corollary 3.12 debate: the Lean code
must reveal exactly where choices, common containers, and real-valued
comparisons enter.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to replace the whole family by the largest epsilon value
without proving that such a value bounds every choice. This module takes the cap
as a hypothesis and makes Lean use it exactly where containment is needed.

### Next Step

The next milestone should start separating the roles that are currently bundled
inside "common target": a toy APT-style transport record should specify how a
chosen output is carried through a named transport before it is compared with a
common target. This keeps the future APT/IPL/SHE decomposition visible instead
of compressing it into one containment hypothesis.

## Milestone 12: Toy APT-Style Transported Outputs

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/TransportedRegionFamily.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyAPTTransport.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows IUT III, Remark 3.11.1, especially the discussion of IPL,
SHE, and APT. Mochizuki says that SHE may be regarded as a kind of parallel
transport mechanism for the Theta-pilot object, but immediately warns that APT
is not simply transport of a set-theoretic region by a set-theoretic function.
Rather, it is a construction algorithm that is simultaneously meaningful relative
to the arithmetic holomorphic structures on both sides of the Theta-link.

Step (xi) in the proof of Corollary 3.12 then says that, for the qualitative
logical part of the argument, one may temporarily forget the hidden theta-
function internals and regard Theorem 3.11 as "some" algorithm transforming
input data into output data satisfying IPL and SHE. Mochizuki's recent
formalization report identifies the APT aspect as the central work in the
second/third triangles of the reorganized proof. Scholze-Stix's critique again
pushes in the same formal direction: every real comparison must keep the
identifications and transports explicit.

### Purpose

The previous toy family treated possible outputs only as a
`RegionComparisonFamily`. That is enough for containment and volume bounds, but
it hides the separate transport and target-region fields inside one comparison.

This milestone introduces:

```text
TransportedRegionFamily source target index
```

with fields

```text
transport    : index -> Transport source target
targetRegion : index -> Region target
```

and a forgetful map to `RegionComparisonFamily`. This is still only a toy
bookkeeping layer. It does not claim to formalize Mochizuki's actual APT
algorithm.

### Lean Declarations

In `TransportedRegionFamily.lean`:

```text
TransportedRegionFamily.comparison
TransportedRegionFamily.comparisons
TransportedRegionFamily.Holds
TransportedRegionFamily.CommonTarget
TransportedRegionFamily.CommonTargetBound
TransportedRegionFamily.CommonTargetHullBound
TransportedRegionFamily.holds_common_of_choice
TransportedRegionFamily.choice_targetVolume_le_of_commonBound
TransportedRegionFamily.allTargetsAtMost_of_commonBound
```

These declarations let us retain explicit transport data until the exact point
where we intentionally forget to the older common-target interface.

In `ToyAPTTransport.lean`:

```text
thetaAPTOutput
thetaAPTOutput_comparison
thetaAPTOutput_comparisons
thetaAPTOutput_commonTarget
thetaAPTOutputCommonTargetBound
thetaAPTOutput_choice_targetVolume_le_bound
thetaAPTOutput_holds_common_of_choice
unitThetaAPTOutput_bound_of_choice_holds
```

`thetaAPTOutput` is the toy transported-output object: each choice uses the
named transport `f`, and the chosen target region is the upper ray
`R_{<= -2h + epsilon choice}`. The comparison and common-target theorems prove
that this structured view agrees with the earlier toy family only after applying
the forgetful map.

### What This Tests

The dependency chain is now more explicit:

1. A choice supplies a named transport and a target region.
2. These form a chosen `RegionComparison`.
3. The transported family may be forgotten to a `RegionComparisonFamily`.
4. Common-target containment and measured bounds are applied only after that
   forgetful step.

This catches a subtle bookkeeping error: a later proof should not be able to
use a common-target estimate while suppressing the transport that produced the
chosen output.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to call an ordinary map of regions "APT". This milestone uses
"APT-style" only for the toy bookkeeping shape and explicitly models no more
than choice-dependent transports and regions. The actual IUT APT construction
remains a future source-specific obligation.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add a small interface for named qualitative properties
of an algorithmic output, such as toy `HasIPL`, `HasSHE`, and `HasAPT` fields,
without making them mathematically powerful. That will let future milestones
state which hypotheses are used when passing from algorithmic output to
common-target bounds.

## Milestone 13: Qualitative Algorithmic Output

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicOutput.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows IUT III, Remark 3.11.1, where Mochizuki names IPL
(`Input prime-strip link`), SHE (`Simultaneous holomorphic expressibility`), and
APT (`Algorithmic parallel transport`) as qualitative properties of the output
of the multiradial construction algorithm. The source says that IPL links the
output data to the input q-pilot prime-strip, SHE says the construction is
simultaneously meaningful relative to the two arithmetic holomorphic
structures, and APT is explicitly not just transport of a set-theoretic region by
a set-theoretic map.

Step (xi) in the proof of Corollary 3.12 then takes a qualitative-logical view
of Theorem 3.11 as an algorithm that transforms input data into output data
satisfying IPL and SHE, while temporarily forgetting hidden theta-function
internals. Mochizuki's recent progress report says the RIMS formalization work
is focused on the APT part of the second/third triangles. Scholze-Stix's critique
again motivates explicit bookkeeping: they object to hidden identifications when
real inequalities are extracted.

### Purpose

The previous milestone made the transported-output family explicit. This
milestone adds a wrapper:

```text
AlgorithmicOutput source target index
```

with fields:

```text
family : TransportedRegionFamily source target index
ipl    : Prop
she    : Prop
apt    : Prop
```

The point is not to make these names prove anything. They are opaque
propositions that future source-specific modules must instantiate.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicOutput.lean`:

```text
AlgorithmicOutput.HasIPL
AlgorithmicOutput.HasSHE
AlgorithmicOutput.HasAPT
AlgorithmicOutput.Certified
AlgorithmicOutput.comparison
AlgorithmicOutput.comparisons
AlgorithmicOutput.Holds
AlgorithmicOutput.CommonTargetBound
AlgorithmicOutput.CertifiedCommonTargetBound
```

`Certified` stores evidence for the named qualitative properties. A
`CertifiedCommonTargetBound` stores both this evidence and the separate
common-target bound. Theorems such as

```text
CertifiedCommonTargetBound.choice_targetVolume_le
CertifiedCommonTargetBound.allTargetsAtMost
```

use the common-target bound field, not the names IPL/SHE/APT alone.

In `ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`:

```text
thetaToyAlgorithmOutput
thetaToyAlgorithmOutput_certified
thetaToyCertifiedCommonTargetBound
thetaToyAlgorithmOutput_choice_targetVolume_le_bound
unitThetaToyAlgorithmOutput_bound_of_choice_holds
```

The toy output sets IPL/SHE/APT to `True`, only to test the interface. The
numerical estimate still needs the explicit epsilon cap, upper-ray normalization,
and common-target bound construction.

### What This Tests

The formal dependency is now visible:

1. A transported output family is present.
2. Qualitative properties can be named and certified.
3. Certification alone does not produce containment or a volume estimate.
4. The real bound is obtained only when a `CommonTargetBound` is also supplied.

This matters for the IUT formalization because the contested Corollary 3.12 step
cannot be allowed to turn labels such as IPL, SHE, or APT into the desired real
inequality without intermediate formal data.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to implement `HasAPT -> CommonTargetBound` as an axiom-like
bridge. This milestone refuses that bridge. It provides only names and explicit
packaging, so future work must prove any bridge from source-specific
constructions.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add a first bridge-shaped theorem schema, still
abstract: if a certified algorithmic output is accompanied by an explicit
common-target-bound constructor, then the chosen target-volume bound follows.
This will make the future "3.11 => 3.11.5" obligation visible as a separate
function/hypothesis rather than as an implicit consequence of APT.

## Milestone 14: Algorithmic Bridge Schema

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyBridge.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows Mochizuki's formalization progress report, where the
reorganized proof separates the second/third triangles from the final
`3.11.5 => 3.12` comparison. The report says that the operation
`(HDD) := (hull+det) o (dsc)` is moved into the intermediate stage and that the
central issue in the second/third triangles is APT: how gluings up to
indeterminacies plus hull are expressed.

The same separation appears in IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step (xi): first one
regards Theorem 3.11 qualitatively as an algorithm producing output satisfying
IPL/SHE/APT; then the construction is enlarged by holomorphic hulls, determinant
formation, and normalized log-volume before comparable real objects appear.
Scholze-Stix's critique again motivates this separation because their objection
concerns precisely the passage from qualitative identifications to a real
inequality.

### Purpose

The previous milestone gave names to IPL, SHE, and APT but did not let them
prove anything. This milestone adds the first bridge-shaped schema:

```text
CommonTargetBoundBridge output measure bound
```

It is a structure with one field:

```text
build : output.Certified -> output.CommonTargetBound measure bound
```

This is the formal slot for a future source-specific proof of the
`3.11 => 3.11.5` obligation. The bridge is explicit data; it is not derived from
`HasAPT`, `HasSHE`, or `HasIPL`.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicBridge.lean`:

```text
AlgorithmicOutput.CommonTargetBoundBridge
AlgorithmicOutput.CommonTargetBoundBridge.apply
AlgorithmicOutput.CommonTargetBoundBridge.choice_targetVolume_le
AlgorithmicOutput.CommonTargetBoundBridge.allTargetsAtMost
AlgorithmicOutput.CommonTargetBoundBridge.preserves_hasIPL
AlgorithmicOutput.CommonTargetBoundBridge.preserves_hasSHE
AlgorithmicOutput.CommonTargetBoundBridge.preserves_hasAPT
```

The first two declarations build a `CertifiedCommonTargetBound` from a
certificate and an explicit bridge. The volume theorems use the common-target
bound produced by `build`.

In `ToyBridge.lean`:

```text
thetaToyCommonTargetBoundBridge
thetaToyCertifiedBridgeBound
thetaToyBridge_choice_targetVolume_le_bound
thetaToyBridge_allTargetsAtMost
thetaToyBridge_hasAPT
```

The toy bridge ignores the trivial certificate and constructs the common-target
bound from the explicit epsilon cap plus upper-ray normalization.

### What This Tests

The proof dependency is now:

1. A qualitative output is certified.
2. A separate bridge constructor is supplied.
3. The bridge produces common-target-bound data.
4. Only then do target-volume bounds follow.

This is the shape we want before any real IUT-specific theorem is attempted.
Lean will not permit us to get from the names IPL/SHE/APT to volume estimates
unless we also provide the bridge.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to encode APT itself as a theorem that returns the target
bound. This module keeps the bridge as an independent hypothesis, so future
work must explain and prove the bridge rather than hiding it in a name.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce an explicit Stage 1 statement that consumes
a certified output, a bridge, and a measured q-pilot value to produce a
Corollary-3.12-shaped real inequality. This should still be a theorem schema:
the nontrivial work remains in the bridge and in the real-line/log-volume
identifications supplied to it.

## Milestone 15: Stage 1 Corollary Schema

Lean files:

* `Iut/Stage1/CorollarySchema.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyCorollarySchema.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows the end of IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step (xi), where
Mochizuki writes the comparable real objects as

```text
R_{<= -|log(Theta)|};  -|log(q)| in R.
```

The displayed conclusion discussed by Scholze-Stix is the signed real
inequality

```text
-|log(q)| <= -|log(Theta)|.
```

This sign convention is easy to mishandle in a formalization because our
`PilotLogVolume.value` field stores the unsigned magnitude. Scholze-Stix's
warning that all copies and identifications of real ordered one-dimensional
spaces must be explicit applies directly here.

The milestone also follows Mochizuki's progress report: after the bridge-shaped
`3.11 => 3.11.5` obligation, the final `3.11.5 => 3.12` step should be the
simultaneous comparison that turns the bridge output into the displayed real
inequality.

### Purpose

The previous milestone supplied an explicit bridge from certified algorithmic
output to a common-target bound. This milestone adds the signed-real final step:

```text
qSigned <= thetaSigned
```

implies

```text
Corollary312Inequality
  (signedPilotLogVolume theta thetaSigned)
  (signedPilotLogVolume q qSigned)
```

where `signedPilotLogVolume side signedValue` stores the positive magnitude
`-signedValue`.

### Lean Declarations

In `CorollarySchema.lean`:

```text
signedPilotLogVolume
corollary312_of_signed_le
stage1Comparison_of_signed_le
corollary312_from_bridge
stage1Comparison_from_bridge
```

The bridge theorem takes:

```text
bridge       : output.CommonTargetBoundBridge measure thetaSigned
certified    : output.Certified
choice       : index
hq_le_choice : qSigned <= targetVolume(choice)
```

and combines `hq_le_choice` with the bridge-produced target-volume bound to get
the Corollary-3.12-shaped inequality.

In `ToyCorollarySchema.lean`:

```text
unitThetaToy_qSigned_le_choiceTargetVolume
unitThetaToyCorollary312
unitThetaToyStage1Comparison
```

The first theorem extracts the q-side signed value from actual membership in the
chosen toy upper-ray target. The final theorem packages the result as a
`Stage1Comparison` when `0 < h`, so the stored q-pilot magnitude is positive.

### What This Tests

The dependency chain is now complete for the toy model:

1. A chosen output membership gives a q-side signed value below the chosen
   target volume.
2. A certified output plus bridge gives the chosen target volume below the
   Theta-side signed bound.
3. Transitivity gives the signed inequality.
4. Only then is the signed inequality converted into the existing
   `Corollary312Inequality` over unsigned pilot magnitudes.

This keeps the exact place of the sign conversion visible in Lean.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to state the final comparison directly as an inequality of
unsigned magnitudes and let Lean's arithmetic hide the negations. This milestone
uses signed real inputs and an explicit conversion to `PilotLogVolume`.

### Next Step

The next milestone should start replacing the toy `True` IPL/SHE/APT
certificates with structured but still abstract records: for example, a named
input link datum for IPL and a named common-ring/holomorphic-structure datum for
SHE. These records should remain inert until a separate bridge theorem consumes
them.

## Milestone 16: Structured Qualitative Data

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/QualitativeData.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows IUT III, Remark 3.11.1. There, IPL is described as
linking output data to the input q-pilot prime-strip via poly-isomorphisms,
SHE is described as simultaneous validity relative to the domain and codomain
arithmetic holomorphic structures, and APT is described as a construction
algorithm rather than set-theoretic transport of a region. Step (xi) of
Corollary 3.12 then says that, for the qualitative logical part of the argument,
one may regard Theorem 3.11 as an algorithm producing output data satisfying
IPL and SHE.

Scholze-Stix's criticism again supports making the bookkeeping explicit: hidden
identifications of real lines or concrete pilot objects should not be smuggled
through labels such as IPL, SHE, or APT.

### Purpose

Previously the toy qualitative output used `True` for IPL/SHE/APT. That was
useful as a placeholder but too featureless for the next milestones. We now add
structured records that are still mathematically inert:

```text
QualitativeData.IPLDatum
QualitativeData.SHEDatum
QualitativeData.APTDatum
```

These records contain labels and, for APT, an explicitly named output family
equal to the family under discussion. They do not imply common-target
containment, hull formation, determinant formation, or any volume estimate.

### Lean Declarations

In `QualitativeData.lean`:

```text
IPLDatum
HolomorphicStructure
SHEDatum
APTDatum
HasStructuredIPL
HasStructuredSHE
HasStructuredAPT
apt_output_eq_family
```

The `HasStructured...` predicates are `Nonempty` wrappers around the data. This
keeps them as propositions suitable for `AlgorithmicOutput`, while preserving a
structured witness for documentation and later refinement.

In `ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`, the toy output now uses:

```text
QualitativeData.HasStructuredIPL (thetaAPTOutput f h epsilon)
QualitativeData.HasStructuredSHE (thetaAPTOutput f h epsilon)
QualitativeData.HasStructuredAPT (thetaAPTOutput f h epsilon)
```

instead of `True`. The existing bridge and Corollary schema continue to work
unchanged, which confirms that these qualitative witnesses remain separate from
the common-target bound.

### What This Tests

This milestone tests that richer qualitative data can be threaded through the
formalization without accidentally gaining mathematical force. The target-volume
and Corollary-style inequalities still require the bridge and the explicit
common-target-bound construction.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to give `APTDatum` a theorem that immediately produces a
common target or volume bound. We only record that a named output family is the
family under discussion. Any actual bridge from APT/IPL/SHE data to hull+det
data remains a future theorem.

### Next Step

The next milestone should refine the bridge schema so that its constructor
explicitly consumes the structured qualitative data, rather than the generic
`Certified` wrapper alone. It should still return a common-target-bound only as
an explicitly supplied source-specific construction.

## Milestone 17: Structured Bridge Schema

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/QualitativeData.lean`
* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyBridge.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone again follows IUT III, Remark 3.11.1 and Corollary 3.12, Step
(xi). IPL, SHE, and APT are not just flags: the source describes IPL as
linking data by prime-strip isomorphisms, SHE as simultaneous expressibility
relative to two arithmetic holomorphic structures, and APT as the construction
mechanism by which gluings up to indeterminacies are expressed. Mochizuki's
formalization progress report says this APT/hull part is exactly the
second/third-triangle work before the final `3.11.5 => 3.12` comparison.

Scholze-Stix's critique warns against jumping from qualitative identifications
to real inequalities without spelling out the concrete comparison data. This
milestone moves in that direction by making the bridge consume structured
qualitative witnesses, while still refusing to make those witnesses powerful by
themselves.

### Purpose

The previous bridge consumed `output.Certified`, which only proved the opaque
properties `output.HasIPL`, `output.HasSHE`, and `output.HasAPT`. We now add a
more explicit certificate:

```text
QualitativeData.StructuredCertificate family
```

with actual IPL, SHE, and APT datum fields. The new bridge schema is:

```text
AlgorithmicOutput.StructuredCommonTargetBoundBridge
```

whose builder has type:

```text
StructuredCertificate output.family -> output.CommonTargetBound measure bound
```

This is still an explicit bridge. Lean does not derive the common-target bound
from the structured certificate alone.

### Lean Declarations

```text

AlgorithmicOutput.StructuredCommonTargetBoundBridge.allTargetsAtMost
```

In the toy files:

```text
thetaToyStructuredCertificate
thetaToyStructuredCommonTargetBoundBridge
thetaToyStructuredBridge_choice_targetVolume_le_bound
thetaToyStructuredBridge_allTargetsAtMost
```

The toy structured bridge ignores the certificate contents and uses the same
explicit epsilon-cap construction as before. That is intentional: the point of
this milestone is dependency shape, not a mathematical claim about IUT.

### What This Tests

The bridge can now be stated as a function of structured qualitative data, but
the volume conclusion still depends on an explicitly supplied bridge. This
preserves the intended separation:

1. Structured IPL/SHE/APT data describe the algorithmic output.
2. A bridge theorem consumes that data.
3. Only the bridge theorem produces common-target-bound data.
4. Only common-target-bound data yields target-volume estimates.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to add a theorem
`StructuredCertificate -> CommonTargetBound`. We do not add such a theorem.
Instead, `StructuredCommonTargetBoundBridge` is the named obligation that future
IUT-specific work must prove.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect the structured bridge to the signed
Corollary-3.12 schema directly, adding a theorem parallel to
`corollary312_from_bridge` that consumes a `StructuredCommonTargetBoundBridge`
and a `StructuredCertificate`.

## Milestone 18: Structured Corollary Schema

Lean files:

* `Iut/Stage1/CorollarySchema.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyCorollarySchema.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone uses the same source passages as Milestones 15 and 17. IUT III,
Corollary 3.12, Step (xi), presents the final comparison as a signed real
inequality involving `-|log(q)|` and `-|log(Theta)|`. IUT III, Remark 3.11.1,
and Mochizuki's formalization progress report locate the nontrivial earlier
work in the IPL/SHE/APT and hull+det stages. Scholze-Stix's critique stresses
that the passage from those qualitative identifications to a real inequality is
exactly where hidden identifications must be avoided.

### Purpose

Milestone 17 introduced a bridge that consumes a structured IPL/SHE/APT
certificate. This milestone connects that bridge directly to the signed
Corollary-3.12 schema.

The new theorem is parallel to `corollary312_from_bridge`, but takes:

```text
bridge      : output.StructuredCommonTargetBoundBridge measure thetaSigned
certificate : QualitativeData.StructuredCertificate output.family
```

instead of the generic bridge plus `output.Certified`.

### Lean Declarations

In `CorollarySchema.lean`:

```text
corollary312_from_structured_bridge
stage1Comparison_from_structured_bridge
```

In `ToyCorollarySchema.lean`:

```text
unitThetaToyStructuredCorollary312
unitThetaToyStructuredStage1Comparison
```

The proof shape is unchanged:

```text
qSigned <= targetVolume(choice)
targetVolume(choice) <= thetaSigned
-----------------------------------
qSigned <= thetaSigned
```

The only difference is that the second inequality now comes from the structured
bridge applied to a structured qualitative certificate.

### What This Tests

The formal end-to-end path now records the qualitative data at the final schema
boundary:

1. structured IPL/SHE/APT certificate;
2. structured bridge to common-target bound;
3. chosen-output membership gives q-side signed comparison;
4. signed Corollary-3.12 inequality follows.

No theorem turns structured qualitative data alone into the final inequality.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to keep the structured certificate visible only in intermediate
toy lemmas and then erase it at the Corollary schema. This milestone makes the
structured data part of the final theorem's interface.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add a small "source obligation ledger" in Lean: named
records for which future IUT-specific theorem must provide the structured
bridge, the q-side signed comparison, and the normalization of the measure.

## Milestone 19: Source Obligation Ledger

Lean files:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows the same Corollary 3.12 Step (xi) display and the
structured-proof decomposition from Mochizuki's formalization progress report.
The source separates several operations before comparable real objects appear:
the multiradial construction with IPL/SHE/APT properties, hull and determinant
formation, normalized log-volume, and finally the signed real comparison. The
Scholze-Stix critique specifically warns that extracting a real inequality
without spelling out all identifications and comparisons is not acceptable.

### Purpose

The final structured schema now has enough moving parts that we need a ledger
of completed obligations. `SourceObligationLedger` records:

```text
certificate          : structured IPL/SHE/APT data
bridge               : structured bridge to common-target bound
choice               : chosen output
q_le_choice          : qSigned <= targetVolume(choice)
q_positive           : positivity of the stored q magnitude
normalization_proof  : proof of the selected normalization statement
```

The `normalization` field is a parameter of type `Prop`, because the real IUT
normalization statement will not be the toy upper-ray normalization.

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
SourceObligationLedger
SourceObligationLedger.corollary312
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison
SourceObligationLedger.hasNormalization
```

In `ToySourceObligations.lean`:

```text
unitThetaToySourceObligationLedger
unitThetaToyCorollary312_from_sourceObligations
unitThetaToyStage1Comparison_from_sourceObligations
```

The toy ledger uses `RegionMeasure.NormalizesUpperRays measure` as its
normalization obligation.

### What This Tests

The final toy path now names every obligation before producing the Stage 1
comparison. This is useful for future IUT work because a missing bridge,
normalization, or q-side signed comparison will be visible as a missing field
instead of being hidden inside a large theorem.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to bundle all obligations into one opaque assumption called
"Theorem 3.11". The ledger breaks the final step into fields that can later be
assigned to precise source lemmas.

### Next Step

The next milestone should begin replacing toy labels in `QualitativeData` with
slightly richer abstract identifiers for prime strips, Hodge-theater sides, and
holomorphic structures, still without giving them mathematical consequences.

## Milestone 20: Qualitative Identifiers

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/QualitativeData.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone follows IUT III, Remark 3.11.1, where IPL is described in terms
of input and intermediate `F x mu` prime-strips, SHE is described in terms of
domain and codomain arithmetic holomorphic structures associated to
Theta-Hodge theaters, and APT is described as a construction mechanism rather
than a set-theoretic map. Step (xi) of Corollary 3.12 then uses this qualitative
data while temporarily forgetting hidden theta-function internals.

Scholze-Stix's critique motivates the same bookkeeping discipline: if several
copies of ordered real vector spaces and pilot objects are involved, labels must
not be hidden in prose.

### Purpose

The previous qualitative records still used raw strings for prime-strip and
structure labels. This milestone replaces those raw fields by typed inert
identifiers:

```text
PrimeStripId
HodgeTheaterSide
HodgeTheaterId
CommonLanguageId
TransportMechanismId
```

These identifiers are still just bookkeeping data. They do not produce
isomorphisms, containments, common targets, or volume estimates.

### Lean Declarations

In `QualitativeData.lean`:

```text
PrimeStripId
HodgeTheaterSide
HodgeTheaterId
CommonLanguageId
TransportMechanismId
```

The existing records now use these identifiers:

```text
IPLDatum.inputPrimeStrip
IPLDatum.outputPrimeStrip
IPLDatum.choicePrimeStrip
HolomorphicStructure.theater
HolomorphicStructure.structureLabel
SHEDatum.commonLanguage
APTDatum.mechanism
```

In `ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`, the toy IPL/SHE/APT witnesses now populate the
typed identifiers instead of raw string fields.

### What This Tests

The existing bridge, ledger, and Corollary schema continue to work after making
the qualitative labels more structured. This confirms again that qualitative
bookkeeping remains separate from the proof-producing bridge layer.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to model a prime-strip identifier as an actual isomorphism or
to make a Hodge-theater identifier carry hidden comparison maps. These are only
typed labels.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add explicit relation records between these
identifiers, such as an inert `PrimeStripLink` and a `SharedHolomorphicContext`,
then thread those through `IPLDatum` and `SHEDatum`.

## Milestone 21: Qualitative Relation Records

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/QualitativeData.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`

### Source Check

This milestone continues the formalization of IUT III, Remark 3.11.1. The IPL
discussion is not merely about two named prime strips; it refers to links via
full poly-isomorphisms of prime strips. The SHE discussion is not merely about
two Hodge-theater labels; it refers to simultaneous expression relative to both
arithmetic holomorphic structures. We still do not formalize those
isomorphisms or structures, but we now give the relation itself a named
bookkeeping object.

This is also consistent with the Scholze-Stix warning: a proof should not hide
which identifications or shared contexts are being used when a real comparison
is extracted.

### Purpose

Milestone 20 introduced typed identifiers. This milestone adds typed inert
relation records:

```text
PrimeStripLink
SharedHolomorphicContext
```

and threads them through:

```text
IPLDatum.link
SHEDatum.sharedContext
```

These records still do not carry actual isomorphisms, functors, containment
maps, or comparisons.

### Lean Declarations

In `QualitativeData.lean`:

```text
PrimeStripLink
SharedHolomorphicContext
```

`PrimeStripLink` stores source and target prime-strip identifiers plus a label.
`SharedHolomorphicContext` stores domain and codomain holomorphic structures
plus a common-language identifier.

In `ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`, the toy structured certificate now uses:

```text
thetaToyPrimeStripLink
thetaToySharedHolomorphicContext
```

inside the existing IPL and SHE witnesses.

### What This Tests

The complete toy Stage 1 path still builds after adding these relation records.
That confirms the identifiers and relations are still inert bookkeeping:
target-volume estimates and signed inequalities continue to require the bridge,
q-side comparison, and normalization ledger.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to encode `PrimeStripLink` as an actual isomorphism. That
would overstate the current formalization. We only name the relation that a
future source-specific module must refine.

### Next Step

The next milestone should introduce similarly inert identifiers for the
hull+det stage: a `HullDetOperationId` and a record linking it to the structured
bridge obligation.

## Milestone 22: Hull+Det Bridge Data

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

Mochizuki's April 2026 formalization report decomposes the route toward
Corollary 3.12 into triangles and explicitly describes an arrow

```text
(HDD) := (hull+det) o (dsc)
```

where `hull+det` is obtained by taking a determinant after passing through the
holomorphic-hull form of the multiradial output. The same passage says that
moving `hull+det` into the `3.11.5` side lets the final `3.11.5 => 3.12`
portion focus on the simultaneous comparison.

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` is the matching source passage. It says
that the multiradial construction, followed by holomorphic hull formation, gives
output data linked to the q-pilot by IPL and expressed in the relevant
holomorphic structure by SHE; then one forms a determinant and applies a
normalized log-volume to obtain comparable real objects.

Scholze-Stix emphasize the opposing diagnostic requirement: when real
comparisons are extracted, all identifications between real-line copies must be
spelled out. Thus this milestone names the hull+det bridge explicitly instead
of letting it disappear inside the final inequality ledger.

### Purpose

The previous bridge record already turned structured qualitative data into a
measured common-target bound. That was too anonymous for the next stage: the
source literature treats the determinant/log-volume passage as a specific proof
step.

This milestone adds a named, inert wrapper:

```text
HullDetOperationId
HullDetBridgeData
```

`HullDetBridgeData` stores both the name of the hull+det operation and the
structured bridge that produces the common-target bound. It does not prove that
the operation is valid, and it does not derive the bridge from the name.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicBridge.lean`:

```text
HullDetOperationId.label
HullDetBridgeData.operation
HullDetBridgeData.bridge
HullDetBridgeData.apply
HullDetBridgeData.choice_targetVolume_le
HullDetBridgeData.allTargetsAtMost
```

In `ToyBridge.lean`:

```text
thetaToyHullDetOperation
thetaToyHullDetBridgeData
thetaToyHullDet_choice_targetVolume_le_bound
thetaToyHullDet_allTargetsAtMost
```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger field

```text
bridge : output.StructuredCommonTargetBoundBridge measure thetaSigned
```

was replaced by:

```text
hullDetBridge : output.HullDetBridgeData measure thetaSigned
```

The final signed inequality still uses the underlying structured bridge, but it
now reaches that bridge through the named hull+det obligation.

### What This Tests

The toy Stage 1 path still proves the same target-volume bound and signed
Corollary-3.12-shaped inequality after the source ledger is strengthened to
require named hull+det bridge data.

This confirms that the new record is bookkeeping only: it makes a future proof
obligation visible without changing the real-valued arithmetic currently proved
by the toy upper-ray model.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to model `HullDetOperationId` as if it already performed the
holomorphic hull, determinant, and normalized log-volume construction. That
would silently assume a major part of the contested source proof. We instead
store an inert identifier and continue to require the bridge as explicit data.

### Next Step

The next milestone should split the current hull+det bridge name into the
composition emphasized in Mochizuki's report: introduce a descent-operation
identifier, a hull+det-operation identifier, and an inert `HDD` composite record
that links descent plus hull+det to the structured bridge obligation.

## Milestone 23: HDD Composite Data

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

Mochizuki's April 2026 report distinguishes the second and third triangles in
the Stage 1 decomposition. The second triangle is the descent arrow `(dsc)`,
which concerns regarding the multiradial representation as constructed from
weaker BPS plus etale-Hodge-theater data up to indeterminacies. The third
triangle defines

```text
(HDD) := (hull+det) o (dsc)
```

as the composite of descent with the elementary `hull+det` operation. The
report then identifies the fourth triangle, `(HDD) o (SHE)`, as the final
simultaneous comparison step leading toward Corollary 3.12.

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` remains the matching technical passage:
the multiradial output is enlarged by holomorphic hulls, converted through
determinants of localized arithmetic vector bundles, and then measured by
normalized log-volume so that q- and Theta-pilot quantities become comparable.

### Purpose

Milestone 22 made hull+det visible in the bridge layer. This milestone prevents
that name from absorbing the descent step. The new declarations make the source
decomposition visible:

```text
DescentOperationId
HDDCompositeData
```

`HDDCompositeData` stores a descent identifier together with a named hull+det
bridge. It still does not assert that descent is valid, that hull+det is valid,
or that their composition has been mathematically constructed.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicBridge.lean`:

```text
DescentOperationId.label
HDDCompositeData.descent
HDDCompositeData.hullDetBridge
HDDCompositeData.structuredBridge
HDDCompositeData.apply
HDDCompositeData.choice_targetVolume_le
HDDCompositeData.allTargetsAtMost
```

In `ToyBridge.lean`:

```text
thetaToyDescentOperation
thetaToyHDDCompositeData
thetaToyHDD_choice_targetVolume_le_bound
thetaToyHDD_allTargetsAtMost
```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger field

```text
hullDetBridge : output.HullDetBridgeData measure thetaSigned
```

was replaced by:

```text
hdd : output.HDDCompositeData measure thetaSigned
```

The final inequality now accesses the structured bridge through
`ledger.hdd.structuredBridge`.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the signed Stage 1 inequality
after the final ledger is strengthened from a hull+det bridge to an HDD
composite. This tests that the extra source-level bookkeeping does not change
the current toy arithmetic proof.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to treat descent as a harmless label already included in
hull+det. In the source decomposition, descent is the place where weaker data
and indeterminacy-controlled construction enter. It needs its own future proof
slot.

### Next Step

The next milestone should expose the fourth triangle by adding an inert
`SHEArrowId` or `SHEBridgeData` and a record for the restricted composite
`HDD o SHE`, then make the source ledger depend on that final composite rather
than directly on HDD.

## Milestone 24: HDD After SHE Composite

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

Mochizuki's April 2026 formalization report describes the fourth triangle as
the composite `(HDD) o (SHE)`. In that triangle, the input data `BPS+etHT` for
`HDD` is obtained by applying the SHE arrow, i.e. simultaneous holomorphic
expressibility, to the q-pilot data constructed from the etale Hodge theater.
The report then says the skeletal Lean work concerns this final triangle: a
simultaneous comparison in a single ring structure/common container between the
Theta-pilot, corresponding to HDD, and the q-pilot, corresponding to SHE.

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` gives the matching mathematical shape:
the output data after holomorphic hull formation is linked to the q-pilot by
IPL and expressed relative to localized arithmetic vector bundles over rings
arising from the arithmetic holomorphic structure in the `1`-column by SHE.
Only after this expression, determinant formation, and normalized log-volume
application are the q- and Theta-side real objects comparable.

Scholze-Stix again supply the diagnostic constraint for this milestone: because
the final conclusion compares real numbers, all identifications and comparison
contexts must be explicit. The SHE datum used by the final composite therefore
must not drift away from the SHE datum in the structured certificate.

### Purpose

Milestone 23 made HDD visible as descent followed by hull+det. This milestone
adds the fourth-triangle wrapper:

```text
SHEArrowId
SHEArrowData
HDDSHECompositeData
```

`SHEArrowData` stores the inert arrow identifier together with the structured
SHE datum. `HDDSHECompositeData` stores the SHE arrow data and the HDD
composite. The source ledger now depends on this final composite.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicBridge.lean`:

```text
SHEArrowId.label

HDDSHECompositeData.hdd
HDDSHECompositeData.structuredBridge

```

```text
thetaToySHEArrow
thetaToySHEArrowData
thetaToyHDDSHECompositeData
thetaToyHDDSHE_choice_targetVolume_le_bound
thetaToyHDDSHE_allTargetsAtMost
```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger field

```text
hdd : output.HDDCompositeData measure thetaSigned
```

was replaced by:

```text
hddShe : output.HDDSHECompositeData measure thetaSigned
she_matches_certificate : hddShe.sheArrow.datum = certificate.she
```

The final inequality now accesses the structured bridge through
`ledger.hddShe.structuredBridge`.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the signed Stage 1 inequality
after the final ledger is strengthened from HDD data to HDD-after-SHE data.
The new `she_matches_certificate` field also tests that the SHE datum used to
restrict HDD is the same SHE datum carried by the structured certificate.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to add an `(HDD) o (SHE)` label while leaving the actual SHE
datum implicit or inconsistent with the certificate used by the bridge. This
would reintroduce a hidden comparison context at precisely the point where the
source dispute demands explicit bookkeeping.

### Next Step

The next milestone should make the "single ring structure/common container"
language explicit by adding an inert common-container record that ties together
the SHE common holomorphic context, the HDD-after-SHE composite, and the
target-side measure used for the final real comparison.

## Milestone 25: Common Container Data

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

Mochizuki's April 2026 report describes the skeletal Stage 1 Lean work as the
fourth triangle: simultaneous comparison relative to a single ring structure,
or "common container", between the Theta-pilot corresponding to HDD and the
q-pilot corresponding to SHE. Earlier in the same report, the toy description
of IUT emphasizes common multiplicative monoid and abstract group data, but not
common ring structures, as the input for an algorithm that constructs a common
container for distinct arithmetic holomorphic structures.

IUT III also uses this language: in the discussion around Theorem 3.11, a
reconstructed Frobenioid is described as a common container in which distinct
pilot choices and their associated data may be compared. This is consistent
with Step `(xi-d)` of Corollary 3.12, where the q- and Theta-side quantities
become comparable only after the holomorphic-hull, determinant, and normalized
log-volume operations place them in the appropriate shared comparison setting.

Scholze-Stix's criticism again supplies the guardrail: if the formalization says
two real-valued objects are compared in a common setting, then the identity of
that setting must be explicit rather than hidden in prose or in an overloaded
bridge.

### Purpose

Milestone 24 named the restricted composite `(HDD) o (SHE)`. This milestone
adds the common-container layer:

```text
CommonContainerId
CommonContainerData
```

`CommonContainerData` stores an inert container identifier, the shared
holomorphic context supplied by SHE, and the HDD-after-SHE composite. The target
measure appears as a type parameter of the record, so the final real-valued
comparison remains attached to the same target-side measuring apparatus.

### Lean Declarations

```text

```

In `ToyBridge.lean`:

```text
thetaToyCommonContainer
thetaToyCommonContainerData
thetaToyCommonContainer_choice_targetVolume_le_bound
thetaToyCommonContainer_allTargetsAtMost
```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger field

```text
hddShe : output.HDDSHECompositeData measure thetaSigned
```

was replaced by:

```text
commonContainer : output.CommonContainerData measure thetaSigned
```

The ledger still records:

```text
she_matches_certificate :
  commonContainer.hddShe.sheArrow.datum = certificate.she
```

and now also proves:

```text
commonContextMatchesCertificate
```

which states that the common-container context agrees with the SHE shared
context in the structured certificate.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the signed Stage 1 inequality
after the final ledger is strengthened from HDD-after-SHE data to common
container data. The proof of `commonContextMatchesCertificate` checks that the
container's shared context, the SHE arrow datum, and the certificate's SHE datum
are aligned by explicit Lean equalities.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to describe a "common container" only in comments while the
actual Lean theorem continues to compare numbers through an anonymous bridge.
This milestone makes the container a formal input to the source ledger without
pretending to have constructed the real IUT common container.

### Next Step

The next milestone should make the real-line comparison discipline sharper by
recording an inert `RealComparisonChart` for the common container, so the final
q- and Theta-side signed reals are explicitly associated with the same target
real-line copy and measure context.

## Milestone 26: Real Comparison Chart

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` says that, after determinant formation
and normalized log-volume are applied, the Theta-side output and q-pilot region
give comparable real objects: an upper ray `R <= -|log(Theta)|` and an element
`-|log(q)|` of `R`.

Mochizuki's April 2026 report describes the same Stage 1 endpoint as a
simultaneous comparison relative to a single ring structure/common container,
and its elementary model says that passing to heights/log-volumes turns the
power map into multiplication on real numbers.

Scholze-Stix emphasize the formal danger: because several ordered
one-dimensional real vector spaces occur, any meaningful inequality requires
consistent identifications of all real-line copies. This milestone adds an
explicit real-comparison chart to record those identifications instead of
letting the final signed inequality use unlabelled `Real` values alone.

### Purpose

Milestone 25 introduced the common container. This milestone adds a real-line
chart for reading q- and Theta-side quantities in the target real-line copy:

```text
RealComparisonChartId
RealComparisonChartData
ChartedCommonContainerData
```

`RealComparisonChartData` records:

```text
qToTarget : Transport source target
thetaToTarget : Transport target target
theta_trivial : Transport.TrivialMonodromy thetaToTarget
```

Thus the q-side real copy must be transported into the target copy explicitly,
and the Theta-side target copy is not silently identified with itself unless the
trivial chart transport is supplied.

### Lean Declarations

```text
RealComparisonChartId.label

```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger field

```text
commonContainer : output.CommonContainerData measure thetaSigned
```

was replaced by:

```text
chartedContainer : output.ChartedCommonContainerData measure thetaSigned
```

and the ledger now proves:

```text
thetaChartTrivial
```

which exposes the triviality of the Theta-side chart loop.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the signed Stage 1 inequality
after the final ledger is strengthened from common-container data to charted
common-container data. The toy chart uses the existing q-to-Theta transport
`f : Transport qLine thetaLine` and the identity transport on `thetaLine`,
whose trivial monodromy is checked in Lean.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to add common-container bookkeeping while still allowing
q-side and Theta-side real numbers to enter the final inequality without an
explicit chart. This milestone keeps the real-copy identifications visible at
the final source-obligation boundary.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect `q_le_choice` to the chart more tightly by
introducing a charted q-value record: the q-side point, its transport into the
target real-line copy, and the proof that the transported coordinate is the
`qSigned` value used in the final source ledger.

## Milestone 27: Charted q-Value

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` identifies `-|log(q)|` as the
log-volume of the region arising from the representation of the q-pilot object
at `(1,0)` in the relevant common setting. This is more specific than merely
having an arbitrary real number on the q-side.

Scholze-Stix's warning about ordered one-dimensional real vector spaces applies
directly here: if a real number is used as the q-side term of the final
inequality, the formalization should record which q-side point it came from and
which chart moved it into the target real-line copy.

### Purpose

Milestone 26 recorded the real-comparison chart. This milestone ties the
q-side scalar in the final ledger to that chart:

```text
ChartedQValueData
```

The record stores:

```text
qPoint : Point source
qSigned_eq : (Transport.map chart.qToTarget qPoint).coord = qSigned
```

Thus `qSigned` is no longer just a bare `Real` parameter of the source ledger;
it is explicitly the coordinate obtained by transporting a q-side point through
the ledger's chart.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicBridge.lean`:

```text
ChartedQValueData.qPoint
ChartedQValueData.qSigned_eq
```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger now has:

```text
qValue : output.ChartedQValueData measure chartedContainer.chart qSigned
```

and proves:

```text
qSigned_eq_chartedQ
```

In `ToySourceObligations.lean`, the toy ledger supplies:

```text
qPoint := qAssignment h
qSigned_eq := rfl
```

because the toy `qSigned` is already
`(Transport.map unitQToTheta (qAssignment h)).coord`.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the signed Stage 1 inequality
after the final ledger is strengthened with a charted q-value. This confirms
that the q-side real term used by the final inequality is tied to the same
transport chart used by the common container.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to record a real comparison chart but still allow `qSigned`
to be chosen independently of that chart. This milestone separates two facts:
the chart determines what `qSigned` is, while `q_le_choice` remains the
mathematical inequality comparing that charted value with the chosen target
volume.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add the analogous charted Theta bound record: the
target-side upper-bound coordinate, the proof that it is the `thetaSigned`
bound in the ledger, and the connection to the common-target bound produced by
the charted container.

## Milestone 28: Charted Theta Bound

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` identifies the Theta-side output as the
upper ray `R <= -|log(Theta)|`, where `-|log(Theta)|` is the negative
log-volume of the holomorphic hull under consideration. Earlier explanatory
material in IUT III says the computation of the holomorphic-hull log-volume
amounts to computing an upper bound for the q-side log-volume.

Mochizuki's 2026 report describes the final triangle as a simultaneous
comparison between the Theta-pilot corresponding to HDD and the q-pilot
corresponding to SHE. Scholze-Stix's criticism again makes the formal
requirement sharper: the Theta-side real bound must be tied to the real-line
chart, not left as an unlabelled scalar.

### Purpose

Milestone 27 charted the q-side scalar. This milestone adds the analogous
Theta-side chart record:

```text
ChartedThetaBoundData
```

It stores:

```text
thetaPoint : Point target
thetaSigned_eq :
  (Transport.map chart.thetaToTarget thetaPoint).coord = thetaSigned
```

The source ledger also now stores:

```text
theta_commonBound : output.CommonTargetBound measure thetaSigned
```

This keeps two facts separate: the charted Theta point determines the real
number `thetaSigned`, while the common-target-bound witness says that
`thetaSigned` is the upper bound produced by the charted container.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicBridge.lean`:

```text
ChartedThetaBoundData.thetaPoint
ChartedThetaBoundData.thetaSigned_eq
```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger now has:

```text
thetaBound :
  output.ChartedThetaBoundData measure chartedContainer.chart thetaSigned
theta_commonBound :
  output.CommonTargetBound measure thetaSigned
```

and provides:

```text
thetaSigned_eq_chartedTheta
thetaCommonBound
```

In `ToySourceObligations.lean`, the toy ledger supplies the target-side point
with coordinate `-(2 * h) + epsilonBound` and obtains `theta_commonBound` by
applying the charted container to the toy structured certificate.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the signed Stage 1 inequality
after adding a charted Theta-bound point and a separate common-target-bound
witness. Lean checks that the identity Theta chart sends the toy Theta point to
the `thetaSigned` coordinate used in the ledger.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to treat the upper bound `thetaSigned` as merely the bound
parameter of a bridge. This milestone makes it both a charted target-side real
coordinate and the bound of a common-target-bound witness.

### Next Step

The next milestone should use the new `theta_commonBound` field directly in the
source ledger's derivation of `qSigned <= thetaSigned`, replacing the current
route through `chartedContainer.structuredBridge` where possible.

## Milestone 29: Direct Common-Bound Final Step

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` presents the final real comparison as
membership of the q-side real value in the Theta-side upper ray
`R <= -|log(Theta)|`. In the current Lean interface, this corresponds to a
chosen target volume being bounded by the stored common-target bound
`thetaSigned`.

This also matches the decomposition in Mochizuki's 2026 report: the earlier
HDD/SHE/common-container machinery supplies the comparable Theta-side output,
and the final Stage 1 step consumes that output as an upper bound.

### Purpose

Milestone 28 added:

```text
theta_commonBound : output.CommonTargetBound measure thetaSigned
```

The final source-ledger theorem still re-entered through
`chartedContainer.structuredBridge`. This milestone changes the final derivation
to use the stored common-target-bound witness directly.

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
qSigned_le_thetaSigned
```

is now the central final inequality:

```text
qSigned <= thetaSigned
```

It is proved by composing:

```text
q_le_choice :
  qSigned <= targetVolume(comparison choice)

TransportedRegionFamily.choice_targetVolume_le_of_commonBound
  theta_commonBound choice :
  targetVolume(comparison choice) <= thetaSigned
```

The existing final outputs:

```text
corollary312
stage1Comparison
```

now call `corollary312_of_signed_le` and `stage1Comparison_of_signed_le`
directly on `qSigned_le_thetaSigned`.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the same signed Stage 1
inequality. The final proof no longer reconstructs the common bound from the
structured bridge; it consumes the common-bound data already recorded in the
ledger.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to keep the final theorem dependent on a hidden bridge
application after introducing explicit charted Theta-bound and common-bound
fields. This milestone makes the last real inequality depend on the stored
upper-bound witness.

### Next Step

The next milestone should make the chosen target volume itself explicit as
charted data: store the chosen output comparison, its target-volume real, and
the equality connecting that real to the middle term in
`qSigned <= targetVolume <= thetaSigned`.

## Milestone 30: Charted Target Volume

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` describes applying normalized
log-volume to various regions in the common setting: the region coming from the
Theta-side output and the region arising from the q-pilot representation. The
final comparison is not just a two-number comparison; it passes through the
measured output region selected from the collection of possibilities.

The explanatory paragraph around the holomorphic hull says that computing the
log-volume of the hull of possible Theta-pilot images yields an upper bound for
the q-side log-volume. In Lean terms, this is exactly the middle term:

```text
qSigned <= targetVolume(choice) <= thetaSigned
```

Scholze-Stix's real-line-copy warning remains relevant: the middle real must be
identified as the measured target-side value in the same charted comparison
context.

### Purpose

Milestone 29 made the final proof use the stored common bound. This milestone
names the middle target-volume real:

```text
ChartedTargetVolumeData
```

It stores:

```text
targetSigned : Real
targetSigned_eq :
  targetSigned = RegionMeasure.targetVolume measure (output.comparison choice)
```

The record is parameterized by the same real-comparison chart as the q- and
Theta-side values, so the middle real is part of the same charted final
comparison.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicBridge.lean`:

```text
ChartedTargetVolumeData.targetSigned
ChartedTargetVolumeData.targetSigned_eq
```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger now stores:

```text
targetVolume :
  output.ChartedTargetVolumeData measure chartedContainer.chart choice
q_le_choice :
  qSigned <= targetVolume.targetSigned
```

and proves:

```text
targetSigned_eq_choiceTargetVolume
targetSigned_le_thetaSigned
qSigned_le_thetaSigned
```

The final inequality now factors through the named middle value.

In `ToySourceObligations.lean`, the toy ledger sets `targetSigned` to the
existing target-volume expression for the chosen comparison, with equality by
`rfl`.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the same signed Stage 1
inequality after the middle real is made explicit. The final proof chain now
has three named pieces: charted q-value, charted chosen target volume, and
charted Theta bound.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to make q and Theta charted while leaving the measured output
volume as an anonymous expression. This milestone exposes the middle term that
links membership in a chosen output region to the common Theta upper bound.

### Next Step

The next milestone should make the selected comparison itself explicit by
storing a named `ChosenOutputData` record with the choice index, the comparison
object, and the equality to `output.comparison choice`.

## Milestone 31: Chosen Output Data

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` refers to a collection of possible
output data produced by the multiradial construction, followed by holomorphic
hull formation. The final real comparison uses a selected member of this
collection before passing to its measured target volume.

This matches the critique-driven discipline we are enforcing: a formal proof
should not silently pass from a family of possibilities to a chosen measured
region. The selected comparison object should be named before its target volume
is measured.

### Purpose

Milestone 30 named the measured middle real. This milestone names the selected
output comparison itself:

```text
ChosenOutputData
```

It stores:

```text
choice : index
comparison : RegionComparison source target
comparison_eq : comparison = output.comparison choice
```

The source ledger now stores `chosenOutput` instead of a bare `choice`, and the
charted target-volume record depends on `chosenOutput.choice`.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicBridge.lean`:

```text
ChosenOutputData.choice
ChosenOutputData.comparison
ChosenOutputData.comparison_eq
```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger now has:

```text
chosenOutput : output.ChosenOutputData
targetVolume :
  output.ChartedTargetVolumeData measure chartedContainer.chart chosenOutput.choice
```

and proves:

```text
chosenComparison_eq_outputComparison
targetSigned_eq_chosenComparisonVolume
```

The existing final inequality now factors through:

```text
qSigned
  <= targetVolume.targetSigned
  = targetVolume(output.comparison chosenOutput.choice)
  <= thetaSigned
```

with the chosen comparison itself available as a named object.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the same signed Stage 1
inequality after replacing the bare choice index with a chosen-output record.
The toy record uses the definitional selected comparison
`(thetaToyAlgorithmOutput unitQToTheta h epsilon).comparison choice`.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to name the measured target volume without naming which
possible output comparison was selected from the family. This milestone makes
the passage from possible outputs to a selected comparison explicit.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect the selected comparison to the q-side point by
storing a charted membership witness: the chosen comparison holds for the
charted q-point, and this membership is the source of `q_le_choice`.

## Milestone 32: Charted Membership Witness

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/AlgorithmicBridge.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` describes the q-pilot representation as
a region in the same common setting in which the Theta-side output regions are
measured. The final inequality uses the fact that the q-pilot data is related
to a selected output possibility before taking the measured target-volume
middle term.

Scholze-Stix emphasize that the comparison of concrete q- and Theta-pilot
objects must not hide the identifications of the real-line copies involved. In
our current interface, that means the q-point, the selected comparison, and the
target-volume inequality should be connected in one explicit witness.

### Purpose

Milestone 31 named the selected output comparison. This milestone adds:

```text
ChartedMembershipData
```

It stores:

```text
holds :
  chosenOutput.comparison.Holds qValue.qPoint
q_le_target :
  qSigned <= targetVolume.targetSigned
```

The second field is still explicit because the general abstraction does not
know that all selected regions are normalized upper rays. In the toy model,
this inequality is proved from membership and upper-ray normalization by
`unitThetaToy_qSigned_le_choiceTargetVolume`.

### Lean Declarations

In `AlgorithmicBridge.lean`:

```text
ChartedMembershipData.holds
ChartedMembershipData.q_le_target
```

In `SourceObligations.lean`, the ledger replaces:

```text
q_le_choice : qSigned <= targetVolume.targetSigned
```

with:

```text
membership :
  output.ChartedMembershipData measure chartedContainer.chart
    qValue chosenOutput targetVolume
```

and proves:

```text
chosenComparisonHoldsQ
qSigned_le_targetSigned
qSigned_le_thetaSigned
```

In `ToySourceObligations.lean`, the toy ledger obtains `holds` from the
existing `hholds` assumption and supplies `q_le_target` using the existing toy
membership-to-volume theorem.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the signed Stage 1 inequality
after the raw q-to-target inequality is moved into a membership witness. This
checks that the final proof chain now records: q-point, chosen comparison
membership, chosen target volume, and Theta upper bound.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to carry `qSigned <= targetSigned` as an isolated inequality
after formalizing the q-point and chosen output. This milestone keeps the
membership relation visible at the same boundary where the inequality enters.

### Next Step

The next milestone should refine this by adding a toy theorem showing
`membership.q_le_target` is definitionally the same inequality as the old
`unitThetaToy_qSigned_le_choiceTargetVolume`, so that future source modules can
replace it with domain-specific membership-to-volume lemmas.

## Milestone 33: Toy Membership Inequality Projection

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` passes from q-pilot representation data
inside the common comparison setting to real log-volume inequalities. In the toy
model, this is represented by the upper-ray theorem
`unitThetaToy_qSigned_le_choiceTargetVolume`.

This milestone does not add new mathematical content. It records, in Lean, that
the source-obligation ledger's new membership field stores exactly that
membership-to-volume proof in the toy case.

### Purpose

Milestone 32 moved the q-to-target inequality into:

```text
membership.q_le_target
```

This milestone adds a theorem exposing the toy implementation:

```text
unitThetaToy_membership_q_le_target_from_sourceObligations
```

The theorem states that the packaged membership inequality is definitionally the
old theorem:

```text
unitThetaToy_qSigned_le_choiceTargetVolume
```

### Lean Declaration

In `ToySourceObligations.lean`:

```text
unitThetaToy_membership_q_le_target_from_sourceObligations
```

The proof is `rfl`, which is intentionally strong: it confirms that no new
hidden conversion was inserted between the toy membership-to-volume lemma and
the source ledger field.

### What This Tests

The toy endpoint still builds, and the new theorem verifies that the source
ledger is merely packaging the old upper-ray membership-to-volume argument.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to hide the origin of `membership.q_le_target` after moving
the inequality into a structured witness. This theorem gives future source
modules a concrete pattern: prove a domain-specific membership-to-volume lemma,
then store it directly in the membership witness.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add an analogous projection for the membership
predicate itself, exposing that the ledger's `membership.holds` is exactly the
chosen-output form of the original `hholds` assumption.

## Milestone 34: Toy Membership Predicate Projection

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` uses the relationship between q-pilot
data and the selected output possibility before passing to measured real
volumes. In the toy model, this relationship is the original `hholds`
assumption:

```text
(thetaToyAlgorithmOutput unitQToTheta h epsilon).Holds choice (qAssignment h)
```

After Milestone 32, the source ledger stores this relation as
`membership.holds` for the selected comparison and charted q-point.

### Purpose

Milestone 33 exposed the packaged inequality proof. This milestone exposes the
packaged membership proof:

```text
unitThetaToy_membership_holds_from_sourceObligations
```

The theorem states that the ledger's `membership.holds` is definitionally the
proof obtained from `hholds` after unfolding:

```text
AlgorithmicOutput.Holds
TransportedRegionFamily.Holds
```

### Lean Declaration

In `ToySourceObligations.lean`:

```text
unitThetaToy_membership_holds_from_sourceObligations
```

The proof is again `rfl`, confirming that the source ledger stores the original
membership assumption in chosen-output form without adding hidden proof
machinery.

### What This Tests

The toy endpoint still builds, and Lean confirms that both parts of the
membership witness are transparent:

```text
membership.holds
membership.q_le_target
```

come directly from the old toy membership assumption and membership-to-volume
theorem.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to structure the ledger so heavily that the original
membership assumption becomes hard to locate. This milestone keeps the origin
of the membership proof explicit for human readers and future source modules.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add a source-ledger theorem packaging the complete
three-term final chain as named data:

```text
qSigned <= targetVolume.targetSigned <= thetaSigned
```

so the final Corollary-3.12 inequality can be audited through a single
intermediate comparison object.

## Milestone 35: Three-Term Comparison Chain

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` presents the final real comparison in a
common real setting: the q-pilot log-volume value is compared with the
Theta-side upper ray obtained from the holomorphic-hull log-volume. The proof
path in our interface passes through a selected measured output target.

The April 2026 report describes this as the final simultaneous comparison in a
single common container. Scholze-Stix's critique requires that such real-number
comparisons keep the relevant real-line identifications explicit. A named
three-term chain is the current minimal audit object for that final step.

### Purpose

Milestones 30-32 named the chosen output, the selected target volume, and the
membership witness. This milestone packages the final numeric chain:

```text
qSigned <= targetVolume.targetSigned <= thetaSigned
```

as:

```text
ThreeTermComparison
```

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
ThreeTermComparison
ThreeTermComparison.q_le_theta
SourceObligationLedger.threeTermComparison
```

`SourceObligationLedger.qSigned_le_thetaSigned` now derives the final
two-term inequality from:

```text
ledger.threeTermComparison.q_le_theta
```

rather than rebuilding the transitivity proof inline.

### What This Tests

The toy source-obligation endpoint still proves the same signed Stage 1
inequality after the final chain is reified as a named record. The
Corollary-3.12-shaped theorem now consumes a separately auditable chain object.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to keep compressing the last comparison into a single
`le_trans` expression after making all intermediate data explicit. This
milestone preserves the middle target-volume term as part of the final proof
artifact.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add a toy projection theorem showing that
`threeTermComparison.q_le_target` is the same proof as the ledger's packaged
membership inequality, and `threeTermComparison.target_le_theta` is the common
bound applied to the chosen output.

## Milestone 36: Toy Three-Term Chain Projections

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/ToySourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

Mochizuki's April 2026 formalization report isolates the final part of
`Theorem 3.11 => Corollary 3.12` as the simultaneous comparison of the
`q`- and `Theta`-pilot objects in a common container. IUT III, Corollary 3.12,
Step `(xi-d)` then emphasizes that the comparable objects are obtained only
after forming the correct determinant/log-volume data and landing in a common
real setting:

```text
R_{<= -|log(Theta)|} subset R; -|log(q)| in R
```

Scholze-Stix's critique identifies this as exactly the place where all
identifications of ordered one-dimensional real vector spaces must be spelled
out before concluding a numerical inequality. For our toy endpoint, this means
that a named three-term comparison is not enough: we also want projection
theorems showing where each field of the chain came from.

### Purpose

Milestone 35 introduced:

```text
ThreeTermComparison qSigned targetSigned thetaSigned
```

This milestone proves that, in the toy source ledger, the two fields of the
three-term comparison are not hiding any extra argument:

```text
qSigned <= targetSigned
targetSigned <= thetaSigned
```

The first field is exactly the ledger's membership inequality. The second field
is exactly the common target bound applied to the chosen output, after rewriting
the charted target signed value to the selected output's measured target volume.

### Lean Declarations

In `ToySourceObligations.lean`:

```text
unitThetaToy_threeTerm_q_le_target_from_sourceObligations
unitThetaToy_threeTerm_target_le_theta_from_sourceObligations
```

Both proofs are `rfl`. This is intentional: Lean confirms that the toy chain
fields are definitionally the expected proof fields, not merely propositionally
equivalent after proof irrelevance.

### What This Tests

The toy endpoint now exposes the final chain in three audit layers:

```text
membership.holds
membership.q_le_target
threeTermComparison.q_le_target
threeTermComparison.target_le_theta
```

This makes the final `q <= theta` proof traceable through the selected target
volume rather than collapsing immediately to a two-term inequality.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to introduce a named chain but then make its fields opaque.
That would give us cleaner Lean terms while losing the audit trail that matters
for the Corollary 3.12 dispute. Here the projection lemmas keep the chain
transparent and ready to be replaced later by source-level IUT lemmas.

### Next Step

The next milestone should promote the same field-origin projections from the
toy endpoint to general source-ledger theorems, so every future source module
gets the same audit hooks without having to reprove them.

## Milestone 37: General Three-Term Chain Projections

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

The April 2026 formalization report describes the final portion of
`Theorem 3.11 => Corollary 3.12` as the simultaneous comparison of `q`- and
`Theta`-pilot objects in a common container. IUT III, Step `(xi-d)` describes the
same comparison as landing in completely comparable log-volume objects in `R`.
IUT IV repeatedly describes the `Theta` side as a container for possible images
whose upper bound absorbs the indeterminacies.

Scholze-Stix's criticism is again directly relevant: a meaningful real
inequality requires all identifications of the ordered one-dimensional real
spaces to be explicit. The ledger should therefore expose not just the final
inequality, but the exact field origins of the final three-term comparison.

### Purpose

Milestone 36 added toy-only projection lemmas. This milestone promotes the same
audit hooks to the general `SourceObligationLedger`, so they are available to
every later source module:

```text
ledger.threeTermComparison.q_le_target
  = ledger.membership.q_le_target

ledger.threeTermComparison.target_le_theta
  = common target bound applied to ledger.chosenOutput.choice
```

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
SourceObligationLedger.threeTerm_q_le_target_eq_membership
SourceObligationLedger.threeTerm_target_le_theta_eq_commonBound
```

Both proofs are `rfl`. The point is definitional transparency: the chain object
does not contain a hidden comparison theorem. Its left field is the membership
inequality, and its right field is the common-bound theorem transported through
the selected charted target-volume equality.

### What This Tests

The general ledger now has reusable field-origin theorems before any toy data
is supplied. Future source files can cite these theorems to audit the path:

```text
chosen output
charted target volume
membership inequality
common target bound
three-term comparison
final q <= theta inequality
```

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to let each source model invent its own explanation of how
the final chain was assembled. That would make it too easy for two source
modules to satisfy the final API in subtly different ways. These general
projection lemmas keep the source-obligation interface itself responsible for
the audit trail.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect the final two-term inequality
`qSigned <= thetaSigned` back to the named three-term comparison with a general
projection theorem, then expose the same path for the packaged
`Corollary312Inequality`.

## Milestone 38: Final Inequality Packaging Projections

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` presents the final comparable objects as
a `Theta`-side upper ray in `R` and a `q`-side signed log-volume value in `R`.
The April 2026 formalization report isolates this final stage as the
`3.11.5 => 3.12` comparison of the two pilot objects. Scholze-Stix's critique
warns that the comparison is meaningful only when the real-line identifications
and the resulting numerical inequality are explicitly accounted for.

In the current Stage 1 schema, the final real-number proof has two last
handoffs:

```text
qSigned <= targetSigned <= thetaSigned
  gives qSigned <= thetaSigned

qSigned <= thetaSigned
  gives Corollary312Inequality
```

This milestone names both handoffs.

### Purpose

The source ledger already exposes the two fields of the three-term comparison.
This milestone makes the final packaging path equally explicit:

```text
ledger.qSigned_le_thetaSigned
  = ledger.threeTermComparison.q_le_theta

ledger.corollary312
  = corollary312_of_signed_le ledger.threeTermComparison.q_le_theta
```

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
SourceObligationLedger.qSigned_le_thetaSigned_eq_threeTerm
SourceObligationLedger.corollary312_eq_threeTermComparison
```

Both proofs are `rfl`, so Lean verifies that no extra comparison theorem or
hidden sign manipulation is introduced between the three-term chain and the
packaged Corollary-3.12-shaped inequality.

### What This Tests

The final general audit path is now:

```text
membership.q_le_target
common target bound on chosen output
ThreeTermComparison.q_le_theta
corollary312_of_signed_le
```

This is still a Stage 1 abstraction. It does not prove the disputed IUT source
obligations. It records exactly which obligations must be supplied before the
Corollary-3.12-shaped inequality follows in Lean.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to leave the last abstraction boundary at
`Corollary312Inequality`, where the reader sees only the final packaged
statement. The new projections force the packaged theorem to point back to the
named three-term chain.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add the analogous projection for
`SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison`, showing that the exported
`Stage1Comparison.comparison` field is the same Corollary-3.12 proof produced
from the named three-term chain and that `q_positive` is simply the ledger's
recorded positivity obligation.

## Milestone 39: Stage 1 Comparison Field Projections

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

The display in IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` compares signed
log-volume data of the form `-|log(Theta)|` and `-|log(q)|` after the relevant
objects have been made comparable in `R`. Our `CorollarySchema.lean` file
therefore stores signed values explicitly and turns them into positive
`PilotLogVolume.value` fields via `signedPilotLogVolume`.

The April 2026 formalization report separates this endpoint from the earlier
APT/IPL/source-obligation work. Scholze-Stix's critique reinforces why this
endpoint should not hide any real-line identification or sign convention inside
a final record.

### Purpose

`Stage1Comparison` is the exported Stage 1 interface. This milestone exposes
where its proof fields come from when constructed from a source ledger:

```text
ledger.stage1Comparison.q_positive
  = ledger.q_positive

ledger.stage1Comparison.comparison
  = ledger.corollary312

ledger.stage1Comparison.comparison
  = corollary312_of_signed_le ledger.threeTermComparison.q_le_theta
```

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_q_positive_eq_ledger
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_comparison_eq_corollary312
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_comparison_eq_threeTermComparison
```

All three proofs are `rfl`. Lean verifies that the exported `Stage1Comparison`
record contains the ledger's positivity proof and the same final comparison
proof already traced through the three-term chain.

### What This Tests

The exported Stage 1 object now has named audit projections for the fields that
matter to the final inequality:

```text
q_positive
comparison
```

This prevents the final API from becoming a place where sign conversion or
proof assembly can disappear from view.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to treat `Stage1Comparison` as a harmless packaging layer.
Packaging layers are exactly where hidden sign conventions become difficult to
inspect. The new projection lemmas keep the packaging layer transparent.

### Next Step

The next milestone should expose the signed pilot-volume fields of
`stage1Comparison`, namely that the exported `theta` and `q` values are exactly
`signedPilotLogVolume PilotSide.theta thetaSigned` and
`signedPilotLogVolume PilotSide.q qSigned`.

## Milestone 40: Stage 1 Signed Pilot-Volume Projections

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)` writes the final comparison in terms of
signed log-volume expressions such as `-|log(Theta)|` and `-|log(q)|`, while
our `PilotLogVolume` record stores a positive magnitude in its `value` field.
`CorollarySchema.lean` therefore uses `signedPilotLogVolume` to keep the sign
conversion explicit:

```text
signedPilotLogVolume side signedValue has value -signedValue
```

This is a small bookkeeping point, but it is directly connected to the broader
audit requirement emphasized by Scholze-Stix: every real-number identification
and sign convention used in the final inequality should be visible.

### Purpose

Milestone 39 exposed the proof fields of `stage1Comparison`. This milestone
exposes the data fields:

```text
ledger.stage1Comparison.theta
  = signedPilotLogVolume PilotSide.theta thetaSigned

ledger.stage1Comparison.q
  = signedPilotLogVolume PilotSide.q qSigned

ledger.stage1Comparison.theta.value = -thetaSigned
ledger.stage1Comparison.q.value = -qSigned
```

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_theta_eq_signed
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_q_eq_signed
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_theta_value_eq_neg
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_q_value_eq_neg
```

All four proofs are `rfl`, so the exported record's pilot-volume fields are
definitionally the signed values advertised by the Stage 1 schema.

### What This Tests

The final exported object now exposes both sides of the sign convention:

```text
thetaSigned -> theta.value = -thetaSigned
qSigned     -> q.value     = -qSigned
```

This makes the final `Corollary312Inequality` package easier to audit without
unfolding the constructor manually.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to hide the sign flip inside the final comparison package and
then reason only about positive magnitudes. The source ledger now has explicit
projection lemmas for the signed-to-positive conversion.

### Next Step

The next milestone should expose the remaining side-label fields of
`stage1Comparison`, confirming definitionally that the exported `theta` side is
`PilotSide.theta` and the exported `q` side is `PilotSide.q`.

## Milestone 41: Stage 1 Side-Label Projections

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

The final Corollary 3.12 comparison distinguishes the `Theta`-pilot side from
the `q`-pilot side. Mochizuki's April 2026 report describes this as the
simultaneous comparison of the `Theta`-pilot and `q`-pilot objects in a common
container. IUT III, Step `(xi-d)`, likewise presents separate `Theta` and `q`
log-volume expressions after they have been made comparable in `R`.

Since Scholze-Stix's critique stresses that the real-number identifications must
be explicit, the bookkeeping labels on the exported `Stage1Comparison` should
also be explicit: the final record should not leave room for the two pilot sides
to be interchanged silently.

### Purpose

Milestone 40 exposed the signed pilot-volume values. This milestone exposes the
side-label fields:

```text
ledger.stage1Comparison.theta_side = rfl
ledger.stage1Comparison.q_side = rfl

ledger.stage1Comparison.theta.side = PilotSide.theta
ledger.stage1Comparison.q.side = PilotSide.q
```

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_theta_side_eq_ledger
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_q_side_eq_ledger
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_theta_side_value
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_q_side_value
```

All four proofs are `rfl`, so the side labels in the exported Stage 1 object
are definitionally the labels assigned by `stage1Comparison_of_signed_le`.

### What This Tests

The exported endpoint now has explicit projections for:

```text
theta side label
q side label
theta signed value
q signed value
positivity proof
comparison proof
```

This gives a fully named audit trail for the current Stage 1 packaging layer.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to regard side labels as harmless metadata. In this project,
labels matter because the disputed comparison distinguishes which side carries
the `Theta`-pilot upper ray and which side carries the `q`-pilot value. The
projection lemmas keep that distinction checkable in Lean.

### Next Step

The next milestone should turn this package audit into a compact theorem that
recovers `corollary312_from_stage1_comparison ledger.stage1Comparison` as the
same proof as `ledger.corollary312`, so users of the exported Stage 1 interface
can move back to the ledger proof without unfolding the record manually.

## Milestone 42: Stage 1 Corollary Recovery

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

The formalization report separates the final `3.11.5 => 3.12` comparison from
the earlier source obligations, while IUT III, Step `(xi-d)`, presents the final
endpoint as a comparison of the `Theta`-side upper ray and the `q`-side signed
value in a common real setting. Our `Stage1Comparison` record is the exported
interface for precisely that endpoint.

Scholze-Stix's criticism makes it important that passing through an exported
interface does not lose the explicit proof path through the chosen real-line
comparison. A user who has only the `Stage1Comparison` should be able to recover
the same Corollary-3.12-shaped proof as the source ledger produced.

### Purpose

This milestone adds compact recovery theorems:

```text
corollary312_from_stage1_comparison ledger.stage1Comparison
  = ledger.corollary312

corollary312_from_stage1_comparison ledger.stage1Comparison
  = corollary312_of_signed_le ledger.threeTermComparison.q_le_theta
```

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_recovers_corollary312
SourceObligationLedger.stage1Comparison_recovers_threeTermComparison
```

Both proofs are `rfl`. This confirms that the exported Stage 1 interface is a
transparent wrapper around the same comparison proof, not a second route to the
final inequality.

### What This Tests

The current Stage 1 packaging audit now runs in both directions:

```text
ledger -> stage1Comparison fields
stage1Comparison -> ledger.corollary312
stage1Comparison -> threeTermComparison.q_le_theta
```

That gives downstream modules a stable theorem to cite when moving from the
public Stage 1 record back to the internal source-obligation ledger.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to allow the final exported API to become detached from the
ledger proof path. The recovery theorems make the exported API and the ledger
API definitionally aligned.

### Next Step

The next milestone should step back from final packaging and add source-ledger
projection theorems for the charted `q` and `Theta` numeric values, connecting
`qSigned` and `thetaSigned` back to the transported chart data that supplies the
real-line coordinates.

## Milestone 43: Charted Signed-Coordinate Projections

Lean file:

* `Iut/Stage1/SourceObligations.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Corollary 3.12, Step `(xi-d)`, says that completely comparable objects
are obtained only after the relevant log-volume constructions land in `R`.
Scholze-Stix's critique focuses on exactly this kind of issue: several ordered
one-dimensional real vector spaces occur, and the identifications among them
must be explicit before a numerical inequality is meaningful.

Our `ChartedQValueData` and `ChartedThetaBoundData` records encode this by
requiring explicit transports into the real-comparison chart:

```text
(Transport.map chart.qToTarget qPoint).coord = qSigned
(Transport.map chart.thetaToTarget thetaPoint).coord = thetaSigned
```

### Purpose

The source ledger already exposed these equalities. This milestone adds two
audit improvements:

```text
ledger.qSigned_eq_chartedQ = ledger.qValue.qSigned_eq
ledger.thetaSigned_eq_chartedTheta = ledger.thetaBound.thetaSigned_eq
```

and reverse-orientation forms:

```text
qSigned = transported q coordinate
thetaSigned = transported Theta coordinate
```

The reverse orientation is often easier to read when auditing how the signed
real numbers used in the final inequality arise from chart data.

### Lean Declarations

In `SourceObligations.lean`:

```text
SourceObligationLedger.qSigned_eq_chartedQ_eq_field
SourceObligationLedger.qSigned_eq_chartedQCoord
SourceObligationLedger.thetaSigned_eq_chartedTheta_eq_field
SourceObligationLedger.thetaSigned_eq_chartedThetaCoord
```

The field-origin projections are `rfl`; the reverse-orientation projections are
the symmetric forms of the stored chart equalities.

### What This Tests

The ledger now has named audit hooks for the real-coordinate inputs to the
final comparison:

```text
q point transported through qToTarget -> qSigned
Theta point transported through thetaToTarget -> thetaSigned
```

This is the beginning of the source-side real-line audit, as opposed to the
final packaging audit completed in the previous milestones.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to let `qSigned` and `thetaSigned` appear as free real
parameters detached from their chart origins. These projections keep the signed
numbers tied to the explicit transports recorded in the ledger.

### Next Step

The next milestone should add analogous field-origin projections for the
selected target-volume equality, connecting `targetVolume.targetSigned` to the
measured target volume of the chosen output.
