# Math Formalization Notes

Date started: 2026-05-27

This file starts the second phase of the project: the transition from Stage 1
infrastructure into the mathematical content behind Mochizuki's Theorem 3.11 to
Corollary 3.12 passage.

The previous diary, `FORMALIZATION_NOTES.md`, records the infrastructure phase:
real-line copies, toy models, source obligations, endpoint packaging, payload
routes, public audits, and structured endpoint audit summaries. It remains the
record for those milestones. New milestones that implement non-inert IUT
mathematics should be recorded here.

## Review Checkpoint: End of Infrastructure Phase

The current Lean scaffold verifies the route:

```text
structured Theorem 3.11 inputs
+ side-condition hypotheses
-> source obligations
-> source audit
-> comparison payload inputs
-> comparison data
-> ComparisonDataEndpoint
-> StructuredEndpointAuditSummary
```

The main current entry point is:

```lean
package.structuredEndpointAuditSummary inputs hypotheses
```

It proves that the public endpoint, comparison data, payload route, and source
audit are tied to one coherent structured route. This prevents endpoint drift,
but it does not prove Mochizuki's hard mathematical claim.

## First Math Boundary

The next phase begins with the currently inert Theorem 3.11 ingredients:

```lean
IUTStage1Theorem311StructuredInputs.hasStructuredIPL
IUTStage1Theorem311StructuredInputs.hasStructuredSHE
IUTStage1Theorem311StructuredInputs.hasStructuredAPT
IUTStage1Theorem311StructuredInputs.algorithmOutputCertified
IUTStage1Theorem311StructuredInputs.hodgeTheaterSHEAlignment
```

These names currently expose structured bookkeeping data only. They do not yet
imply common-container comparison data, log-volume bounds, real-line-copy
identifications, or the Corollary 3.12 endpoint.

## Source Alignment

IUT III, Remark 3.11.1, identifies the key qualitative ingredients of Theorem
3.11:

* IPL: input prime-strip linkage;
* SHE: simultaneous holomorphic expressibility;
* APT: algorithmic parallel transport;
* HIS: hidden internal structures, where one reasons about qualitative output
  data without carrying all theta-function internals.

Mochizuki's 2026 formalization report isolates the final `3.11.5 -> 3.12`
portion as the simultaneous comparison around `(HDD) o (SHE)`, while the
second/third triangles concern APT plus IPL.

The Scholze-Stix diagnostic constraint remains active: any formal bridge from
structured source data to a real-valued endpoint must expose the real-line-copy
identifications and must not silently erase Hodge-theater/ring-history data.

## Phase 2 Starting Decision

The first non-inert mathematical target should be SHE.

Reason:

* SHE already appears in the current scaffold as the alignment between the
  common-container SHE arrow and the structured certificate.
* It is local enough to strengthen without claiming the full multiradial
  algorithm.
* It is directly relevant to the contested question of simultaneous comparison
  without collapse of histories.

The first planned math milestone should introduce a record tentatively named:

```lean
StructuredSHEContext
```

It should be strong enough to recover the existing inert `SHEDatum`, but weak
enough that it does not by itself imply the Corollary 3.12 endpoint.

## Guardrail

No theorem in this phase may turn IPL, SHE, APT, HIS, or any single qualitative
name into the endpoint unless every required transport, comparison target,
real-line-copy identification, and Hodge-theater history condition appears in
the theorem statement or an explicit dependency.

## Math Milestone 1: Conservative Structured SHE Context

Lean files:

* `Iut/Foundations/QualitativeData.lean`
* `Iut/Stage1/ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`

### Source Check

IUT III, Remark 3.11.1 describes SHE as simultaneous holomorphic
expressibility: the relevant construction and output data should be expressed in
terms that are valid relative to both the domain and codomain arithmetic
holomorphic structures. Mochizuki's 2026 report identifies `(HDD) o (SHE)` as
the final Stage 1 comparison focus. Scholze-Stix's criticism remains the
guardrail: simultaneous expression must not silently become identification of
the two histories or of their real-line copies.

### Purpose

The existing `SHEDatum` only stored a shared context. This milestone introduces
a first stronger SHE object, `QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext`, without
making SHE prove any comparison endpoint.

The new context records:

* domain and codomain holomorphic structures;
* a common language;
* q-pilot and Theta-pilot holomorphic structures;
* explicit placement of the q-pilot in the codomain theater;
* explicit placement of the Theta-pilot in the domain theater;
* a proposition witnessing simultaneous validity;
* an explicit proof that the domain and codomain Hodge-theater sides are not
  identified.

### Lean Declarations

In `QualitativeData.lean`:

```text
QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext
QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext.sharedContext
QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext.sheDatum
QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext.hasStructuredSHE
QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext.qPilotTheater_eq_codomain
QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext.thetaPilotTheater_eq_domain
QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext.simultaneousValid
QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext.domainHistory_ne_codomainHistory
QualitativeData.StructuredSHEContext.sheDatum_sharedContext
```

In `ToyQualitativeOutput.lean`:

```text
thetaToyStructuredSHEContext
thetaToyStructuredSHEContext_sheDatum
thetaToyStructuredSHEContext_hasStructuredSHE
thetaToyStructuredSHEContext_histories_not_identified
```

### What This Tests

The toy example satisfies the stronger SHE context while proving only the
conservative projections:

* it recovers the old inert `SHEDatum`;
* it recovers `HasStructuredSHE`;
* it records that the toy domain and codomain histories are not identified.

It does not prove a common-target bound, payload route, public audit, or
Corollary-3.12-shaped endpoint.

### Design Trap Avoided

The trap would be to let "SHE" become a magic theorem producing the comparison
payload. This milestone does the opposite: it strengthens the data shape while
only projecting back to existing inert evidence. The extra fields make future
bridges state exactly what simultaneous validity and history separation mean.

### Next Step

The next milestone should connect `StructuredSHEContext` to the source-facing
`IUTStage1Theorem311SHEAlignment` field, again as a conservative projection
rather than as an endpoint theorem.
