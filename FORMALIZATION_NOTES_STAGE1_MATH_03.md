# Stage 1 Mathematical Formalization Notes, Part 03

This file continues `FORMALIZATION_NOTES_STAGE1_MATH_02.md`.

The immediate focus is the lowest currently visible input in the direct route:
constructing packet-local-object estimates from local/cusp data, while keeping
the Corollary 3.12 real-line and label-identification questions explicit.

## 104. Transition Audit: Current Route Boundary

### Verified State

The current Lean route proves the target-to-Theta-average bound from the
following direct-branch inputs:

```text
packet-local-object estimates for cusp classes and zero
direct packet normalization for each audited packet
target capsule estimates for each audited packet
```

It also exposes an `(Ind2)` transported branch where source capsule estimates
and source packet-normalization compatibility are transported across an audited
`(Ind2)` direct-summand step.

The current code has no proof holes:

```text
rg "sorry|admit|axiom|unsafe" Iut/Stage1
```

The only match is the word "unsafe" in a prose comment.

### Mathematical Boundary

The next real construction target is:

```text
cusp/zero local-object estimates attached to the packet local object
```

This is lower than the previous average-level and packet-normalized assumptions.
It is also the right place to connect the Stage 1 source route back to the
foundation layer:

```text
LocalLabCuspModel
CuspLabelClassData
ZMod sign-label quotient
local tensor packets/log-shell objects
```

### Guardrails

The next Lean moves should preserve these distinctions:

```text
zero label vs nonzero sign-label quotient
labelwise equality vs equality of averages
source packet vs target packet under (Ind2)
packet local object vs arbitrary local object
```

We should not introduce a theorem that silently identifies all of these as the
same object.  Any new constructor should make the identification source visible
in its fields or in a source-classification theorem.

## 105. Classifying Packet-Local-Object Estimate Sources

### Goal

We made the source of packet-local-object estimates explicit.

### Lean Move

We added:

```text
IUTStage1PacketLocalObjectEstimateSource
```

with the cases:

```text
directLocalCuspConstruction
ind2TransportedLocalCuspConstruction
separateLocalObjectEstimate
```

and wrapped the packet-local-object audit in:

```text
FLZModCuspLabelThetaClassifiedPacketLocalObjectContainerAudit
```

The wrapper has constructors for each source case and inherits the direct
packet endpoint:

```text
targetSigned_le_thetaSourceAverage_of_directPacket
```

### Mathematical Point

The current lowest-level assumption is no longer an anonymous packet-local
object estimate.  Any route using these estimates can now say whether they are
intended to come from direct local/cusp construction, from transported local
cusp construction, or from a separate local-object estimate.

### Trap Avoided

This prevents us from silently treating a separately supplied real-line/local
object identification as though it had been constructed from the actual local
cusp data.  That distinction is one of the main things the formalization is
supposed to police.

### Toy Check

The examples now check:

```text
placeAudited_logVolume_fl_zmod_classified_packet_local_object_direct_example
placeAudited_logVolume_fl_zmod_classified_packet_local_object_target_bound_example
```

### Remaining Gap

The classification still does not construct the estimates.  The next target is
to define a local/cusp construction interface whose output is a classified
packet-local-object estimate with source
`directLocalCuspConstruction`.

## 106. Foundation Anchor for Packet-Local-Object Estimates

### Goal

We exposed the canonical `ZMod l` local cusp-label model at the
packet-local-object estimate layer.

### Lean Move

Inside:

```text
FLZModCuspLabelThetaPacketLocalObjectContainerAudit
```

we added:

```text
localLabCuspModel_eq_zmod
cuspLabelClassData_eq_zmod
```

These theorems project the existing foundation facts carried by the
`FLZModCuspLabelAveragedInd12Audit` inside the Theta source.

### Mathematical Point

The packet-local-object estimate layer is now visibly tied to the canonical
foundation data:

```text
LocalLabCuspModel = zmodLocalLabCuspModel l
CuspLabelClassData = zmodCanonicalCuspLabelClassData l
```

This matters because the next construction should not treat cusp labels as an
anonymous finite type.  The estimates must be attached to the same canonical
`ZMod l` cusp-label model used by the label average.

### Trap Avoided

We did not introduce a second, independent cusp-label model at the packet-local
object layer.  The theorems project the model already carried by the audited
Theta source, so any later mismatch between the estimate source and the label
average has to appear as an explicit failure.

### Toy Check

The examples now check:

```text
placeAudited_logVolume_fl_zmod_packet_local_object_cusp_model_example
placeAudited_logVolume_fl_zmod_packet_local_object_cusp_data_example
```

### Remaining Gap

The actual construction of packet-local-object estimates from this canonical
cusp-label data remains open.  The next Lean step should introduce only the
minimal interface needed to say that such estimates are produced from the
canonical local cusp construction.

## 107. Shared Packet Local-Object Estimate for All Cusp Labels

### Goal

We reduced labelwise freedom in the packet-local-object estimate layer.

### Lean Move

We added:

```text
FLZModCuspLabelThetaSharedPacketLocalObjectEstimateAudit
```

This audit supplies, for each audited packet, one local-object container
estimate for the packet local object's finite log-volume:

```text
packetLocalObjectEstimate audited
```

It also supplies explicit equalities from each cusp-class and zero log-volume
to that packet finite log-volume.

Lean then constructs:

```text
toPacketLocalObjectContainerAudit
toClassifiedPacketLocalObjectContainerAudit
estimateSource_eq_direct
```

The cusp and zero estimates are obtained by transporting the single packet
local-object estimate along the corresponding log-volume equality.

### Mathematical Point

This is closer to the intended local picture than arbitrary per-label local
object estimates.  The formal route now has an intermediate layer saying:

```text
one packet local object supplies the local estimate
all cusp/zero log-volumes are explicitly identified with that object
```

Only after those identifications are provided do we obtain the labelwise
packet-local-object estimates.

### Trap Avoided

We did not allow each label to silently choose its own local object.  Every
labelwise estimate is transported from the same packet local-object estimate,
and the source is classified as `directLocalCuspConstruction`.

### Toy Check

The examples now check:

```text
placeAudited_logVolume_fl_zmod_shared_packet_object_to_packet_local_example
placeAudited_logVolume_fl_zmod_shared_packet_object_to_classified_example
placeAudited_logVolume_fl_zmod_shared_packet_object_source_example
```

### Remaining Gap

The shared packet estimate still requires explicit cusp/zero log-volume
equalities.  The next construction should connect those equalities to the
canonical nonzero sign-label quotient and the separate zero label, rather than
treating them as unstructured real-line equalities.
